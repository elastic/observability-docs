## Backporting

Pull requests should be tagged with the target version of the Elastic Stack.
In general, we only backport documentation changes to [live stack versions](https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/25bfa6722e52b0e7e1a18e5c12d1ec9f7c84c0c7/conf.yaml#L59).

After your PR is merged, we recommend using the [backport tool](https://github.com/sqren/backport) to easily open backport PRs:
`npx backport`. Alternatively, ping **[@obs-docs](https://github.com/orgs/elastic/teams/obs-docs)** and we'd be happy to handle the backport process for you.
