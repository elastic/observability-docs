This template can be used for creating tutorials within the Observability documentation.
This should give you a format to follow and make it easier for you to get started writing
your tutorial. You can use this asciidoc template as a framework, replacing the text with your own. 

// The title of your tutorial should focus on what the reader will achieve.
// For example, How to ingest custom data into Elasticsearch.
// The anchor id name, in this case [[tutorial-title]], must be unique and can only be used once in a doc. You can link to any ID within a document. For example,
// if you need to link to this section from elsewhere, you would use <<tutorial-title>> as the reference. 
[[tutorial-title]]
= Tutorial title

Introduce the reader to what they will do in this tutorial and provide a list
of what the reader will learn. If required, include links to topics within the Observability docs. 

When you have finished this tutorial, you will be familiar with:

// This is an ordered list and each item is using a shared attribute for the
// product name. Shared attributes can be found here: https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/shared/attributes.asciidoc
. Installing {es}
. Installing {kib}
. Installing {filebeat}


// This float marker is placed before a section header so that each section in this file remains on the same page when converted to HTML.
[float]
[[what-you-need]]
// The section heading. 
== What you need

Use this section to tell the reader what they will need, or any prerequisite knowledge
they require to complete the tutorial.


[float]
[[the-first-step]]
== Step 1: The first step

Break your tutorial down into discrete steps that the reader can follow. A task should be broken 
down into as many steps as are needed.

To highlight a command within a sentence, use this format: `sample command`.

To include code or command blocks, use a code block. Specify the source language, as we use the language 
as a hint for the syntax highlighter. For example; 

[source,shell]
----
./elastic-agent -c elastic-agent-standalone.yml run
----

To include a sample file, specify the source format. For example:

[source,json]
{
    "sample_id": ENT,
    "sample_name": "String",
    "sample_number": INT,
    "line_number": "String",
    "speaker": "String",
    "text_entry": "String",
}

To include an image, save it in a folder in the Observability-docs repo, and
include it using a path relative to the document where the `image::` statement appears. For example, 
this image is saved in the `images` directory:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/my-image.png[Alt text]


[float]
[[the-next-step]]
== Step 2: The next step

Step 2 should follow logically from the first step. Try not to double back on content covered in Step 1.
A good approach would be to work through the task, noting the steps in order as you do.

[float]
[[add-more-steps]]
== Step 3: Add more steps

Add as many steps as you need to guide the reader through the process.

[float]
[[learn-more]]
== Learn more

Now that the reader has completed your tutorial, provide a list of resources, or related features,
for further reading. This can be a bulleted list of links or a set of steps the reader should take next.

// This first bullet point is an external link to the web site
* https://www.elastic.co/blog/kubernetes-observability-tutorial-k8s-monitoring-application-performance-with-elastic-apm[Kubernetes blog]
// Using the `{logs-guide}` shared attribute, this second bullet point is an internal link to a page within the Logs monitoring guide.
// Shared attributes can be found here: https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/shared/attributes.asciidoc
