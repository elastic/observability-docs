=== Create an alert

[float]
==== Overview

To use the alerting functionality you need to {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-setup-prerequisites[set up alerting].

You can then select the *Create alert* option, from the *Alerts* actions dropdown.

[float]
==== Fields and comparators

The comparators available for conditions depend on the chosen field. The combinations available are:

- Numeric fields: *more than*, *more than or equals*, *less than*, *less than or equals*, *equals*, and *does not equal*.
- Aggregatable fields: *is* and *is not*.
- Non-aggregatable fields: *matches*, *does not match*, *matches phrase*, *does not match phrase*.

==== Action messages

To provide additional information about an alert, you can include basic and advanced variables in your action message.

**Basic variables**

- `alertName`: The name of the alert
- `context.alertState`: The current state of the alert. This value is usually **Alert**. However, if you selected *Alert me if there's no data*, the value can also be **No Data**
- `context.group`: The *group* that the alert message concerns, if you've specified a value in *Create alert per*
- `context.reason`: A verbose description of why the alert is in the reported `alertState`. For example, *my.metric is above a threshold of 1.0 (current value is 1.5)*
- `context.timestamp`: The time at which the message was sent

**Advanced variables**

If you'd like more customization than `context.reason` provides, you can also construct a message with the following advanced variables. 

Using the structure of `context.{advancedVariableName}.condition{n}`, each of these variables is a record containing information about each alert condition. For example, if your alert has two conditions, you can access the value of both using:

[source,text]
----
{{context.value.condition0}}
{{context.value.condition1}}
----

- `context.metric.condition{n}`: The metrics that each `condition{n}` is reporting on
- `context.value.condition{n}`: The current value of the `context.metric.condition{n}`
- `context.threshold.condition{n}`: The threshold value of this condition
