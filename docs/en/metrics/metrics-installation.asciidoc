[[install-metrics-monitoring]]
[role="xpack"]
== Get started

To use the {metrics-app}, you need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib}
(version 6.5 or later) for visualizing and managing it.

To ingest data, you can use {metricbeat} installed on each server you want to monitor, or
third-party collectors that are configured to ship ECS-compliant data. The <<metrics-fields-reference>>
provides a list of all fields used in the {metrics-app}. 

If your data uses nonstandard fields, you may need to modify some default <<configure-metrics-source,configuration settings>>.
To modify configurations, use the <<configure-metrics-source,Settings tab>> in the {metrics-app}.
Alternatively, see {kibana-ref}/infrastructure-ui-settings-kb.html[{metrics} settings] for
a complete list of metrics configuration settings.

[[before-you-begin-metricbeat]]
=== Before you begin

To get started quickly, spin up a deployment of our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}]. The deployment includes
{es} and {kib}, and is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. {ess-trial}[Try {ess} for free].

To install {metricbeat} from {kib}, on the machine where you want to collect the data, open a {kib} browser window.
In the *Observability* section displayed on the home page of {kib}, click *Add metric data*.
Now follow the instructions for the type of data you want to collect.
The instructions include how to install and configure {metricbeat}, and enable the appropriate {metricbeat} integration for your data.

Alternatively, you can install and self manage {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[{es}]
and {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[{kib}]. First see the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix]
for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.

[[download-install-metricbeat]]
=== Step 1: Download and install {metricbeat}

Install {metricbeat} as close as possible to the service you want to monitor. For example, if you have four servers with
MySQL running, it’s recommended that you run {metricbeat} on each server. This allows {metricbeat} to access your service from
localhost and does not cause any additional network traffic or prevent {metricbeat} from collecting metrics when there are
network problems. Metrics from multiple {metricbeat} instances will be combined on the Elasticsearch server.

To download and install {metricbeat}, see {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html#install[Installing {metricbeat}]
and use the commands that work with your system.

[[configuring-metricbeat]]
=== Step 2: Configure {metricbeat}

Now that you have completed the Metricbeat download and installation process, the next step is to configure {metricbeat}.

. Connect to {es} and {kib}.
+
Connections to {es} and {kib} are required to set up Metricbeat. Set the connection information in `metricbeat.yml`.
To locate this configuration file, see {metricbeat-ref}/directory-layout.html[Directory layout].
+
For information on how to connect to the {es} and {kib}, see {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html#set-connection[Connecting
to Elastic Stack].

. Enable {metricbeat} integrations.
+
{metricbeat} uses integrations to collect metrics for populating the {metrics-app} with data. Each integration defines the basic
logic for collecting data from a specific service, such as Redis or MySQL. An
integration consists of metricsets that fetch and structure the data. Read
{metricbeat-ref}/how-metricbeat-works.html[How Metricbeat works] to learn more.
+
See {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html#enable-modules[Enabling and configuring metrics collection modules]
for information on how to identify which integrations are available, how to enable them, and how to
configure them.
+
[TIP]
========= 
If you're monitoring Docker containers or Kubernetes pods, you can use autodiscovery to automatically change the configuration settings in response to changes in your containers.
Autodiscovery ensures that even when your container configuration changes, data is still collected.
To learn how to do this, see {metricbeat-ref}/configuration-autodiscover.html[{metricbeat} autodiscover configuration]
=========

. Set up assets.
+
{metricbeat} comes with predefined assets for parsing, indexing, and visualizing your data. For information on how to load these assets, see
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html#setup-assets[Setting up assets].

[float]
[[starting-metricbeat]]
=== Step 3: Start {metricbeat}

Before starting {metricbeat}, modify the user credentials in `metricbeat.yml` and specify a user who is {metricbeat-ref}/privileges-to-publish-events.html[authorized to publish events].

To start {metricbeat}, see {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html#start[Starting {metricbeat}]
and use the commands that work with your system.

[float]
[[verify-metricbeat-data]]
=== Step 4: Verify your data in {kib}

{metricbeat} comes with pre-built {kib} dashboards and UIs for visualizing log data. You loaded the dashboards earlier when you
ran the `setup` command as part of setting up assets.  The dashboards are provided as examples. We recommend that you {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[customize them]
to meet your needs.

For more information, see {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html#view-data[Viewing your data in {kib}].
