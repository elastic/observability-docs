An ((observability)) project allows you to run Elastic ((observability)) in an autoscaled and fully-managed environment,
where you don't have to manage the underlying ((es)) cluster or ((kib)) instances.

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and log in to your account.
1. Within **Serverless projects**, click **Create project**.
1. Under **Observability**, click **Next**.
1. Enter a name for your project.
1. (Optional) Click **Edit settings** to change your project settings:
    * **Cloud provider**: The cloud platform where you’ll deploy your project. We currently support Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    * **Region**: The <DocLink slug="/serverless/regions" text="region"/> where your project will live. The region should be as close as possible to the location of your data.
1. Click **Create project**. It takes a few minutes to create your project.
1. When the project is ready, click **Continue**.

From here, you can start adding logs and other observability data.
