An {observability} project allows you to run {observability} in an autoscaled and fully-managed environment,
where you don't have to manage the underlying {es} cluster or {kib} instances.

. Navigate to https://cloud.elastic.co/[cloud.elastic.co] and log in to your account.
. Within **Serverless projects**, click **Create project**.
. Under **Observability**, click **Next**.
. Enter a name for your project.
. (Optional) Click **Edit settings** to change your project settings:
+
** **Cloud provider**: The cloud platform where youâ€™ll deploy your project. We currently support Amazon Web Services (AWS).
** **Region**: The <<regions,region>> where your project will live.
. Click **Create project**. It takes a few minutes to create your project.
. When the project is ready, click **Continue**.

From here, you can start adding logs and other observability data.
