Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an essential layer of security to
applications login processes, protecting against unauthorized access. A very
common usecase in Synthetics is testing user journeys that involves websites
behind protected behind MFA.

Synthetics supports testing websites secured by Time-based One-Time Password
(TOTP), a common MFA method that provides short lived One Time tokens that are
desirable for enhancing security. 

## Configuring using TOTP

To test a browser journey that uses TOTP for MFA, you need to first configure the
Synthetics authenticator token in your application. To do that, you can generate a One
Time Password (OTP) using the Synthetics CLI, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/synthetics-command-reference" section="@elastic/synthetics totp <secret>">.

```sh
npx @elastic/synthetics totp <secret>

// prints
OTP Token: 123456
```

## Using TOTP token inside the journeys

Once the Synhetics TOTP Authentication is configured in your application, you can now use the OTP token in the synthetics browser
journeys using the `mfa` object imported from `@elastic/synthetics`.

```ts
import { journey, step, mfa } from "@elastic/synthetics";

journey("MFA Test", ({ page, params }) => {
  step("Login using TOTP token", async () => {
    // login using username and pass and go to 2FA in next page
    const token = mfa.token(params.MFA_GH_SECRET);
    await page.getByPlaceholder("token-input").fill(token);
  });
});
```

For monitors that are created from the Synthetics UI using the Script editor, `mfa` object can be accessed as shown below:

```ts
step("Login using 2FA", async () => {
  const token = mfa.token(params.MFA_GH_SECRET);
  await page.getByPlaceholder("token-input").fill(token);
});
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">

`params.MFA_GH_SECRET` would be the encoded secret that was used for registering the Synthetics Authentication in your web application.
