Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an essential layer of security to
applications login processes, protecting against unauthorized access. A very
common use case in Synthetics is testing user journeys involving websites
protected by MFA.

Synthetics supports testing websites secured by Time-based One-Time Password
(TOTP), a common MFA method that provides short-lived one-time tokens to
enhance security.

## Configuring TOTP for MFA

To test a browser journey that uses TOTP for MFA, first configure the
Synthetics authenticator token in the target application. To do this, generate a One-Time
Password (OTP) using the Synthetics CLI; refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/synthetics-command-reference" section="@elastic/synthetics totp <secret>">`@elastic/synthetics totp <secret>`</DocLink>.

```sh
npx @elastic/synthetics totp <secret>

// prints
OTP Token: 123456
```

## Applying the TOTP Token in Browser Journeys

Once the Synthetics TOTP Authentication is configured in your application, you can now use the OTP token in the synthetics browser
journeys using the `mfa` object imported from `@elastic/synthetics`.

```ts
import { journey, step, mfa } from "@elastic/synthetics";

journey("MFA Test", ({ page, params }) => {
  step("Login using TOTP token", async () => {
    // login using username and pass and go to 2FA in next page
    const token = mfa.token(params.MFA_GH_SECRET);
    await page.getByPlaceholder("token-input").fill(token);
  });
});
```

For monitors created in the Synthetics UI using the Script editor, the `mfa` object can be accessed as shown below:

```ts
step("Login using 2FA", async () => {
  const token = mfa.token(params.MFA_GH_SECRET);
  await page.getByPlaceholder("token-input").fill(token);
});
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">

`params.MFA_GH_SECRET` would be the encoded secret that was used for registering the Synthetics Authentication in your web application.
