= ECS formatted application logs

:description: Use an ECS logger or an {apm-agent} to format your logs in ECS format.
:keywords: serverless, observability, how-to

preview:[]

Logs formatted in Elastic Common Schema (ECS) don't require manual parsing, and the configuration can be reused across applications. ECS-formatted logs, when paired with an {apm-agent}, allow you to correlate logs to easily view logs that belong to a particular trace.

You can format your logs in ECS format the following ways:

* <<ecs-application-logs-ecs-loggers,**ECS loggers:**>> plugins for your logging libraries that reformat your logs into ECS format.
* <<reformatting-logs,**{apm-agent} ECS reformatting:**>> Java, Ruby, and Python {apm-agent}s automatically reformat application logs to ECS format without a logger.

== ECS loggers

ECS loggers reformat your application logs into ECS-compatible JSON, removing the need for manual parsing.
ECS loggers require {filebeat} or {agent} configured to monitor and capture application logs.
In addition, pairing ECS loggers with your framework's {apm-agent} allows you to correlate logs to easily view logs that belong to a particular trace.

== APM agent ECS reformatting

Java, Ruby, and Python {apm-agent}s can automatically reformat application logs to ECS format without an ECS logger or the need to modify your application. The {apm-agent} also allows for log correlation so you can easily view logs that belong to a particular trace.

To set up log ECS reformatting:

. <<ecs-application-logs-enable-log-ecs-reformatting,Enable {apm-agent} reformatting>>
. <<ecs-application-logs-ingest-logs,Ingest logs with {filebeat} or {agent}.>>
. <<ecs-application-logs-view-logs,View logs in Logs Explorer>>

[[ecs-application-logs-enable-log-ecs-reformatting]]
=== Enable log ECS reformatting

Log ECS reformatting is controlled by the `log_ecs_reformatting` configuration option, and is disabled by default. Refer to the guide for your framework for information on enabling:

* {apm-java-ref}/config-logging.html#config-log-ecs-reformatting[Java]
* {apm-ruby-ref}/configuration.html#config-log-ecs-formatting[Ruby]
* {apm-py-ref}/configuration.html#config-log_ecs_reformatting[Python]

[[ecs-application-logs-ingest-logs]]
=== Ingest logs

After enabling log ECS reformatting, send your application logs to your project using one of the following shipping tools:

* <<ecs-application-logs-ingest-logs-with-filebeat,**{filebeat}:**>> A lightweight data shipper that sends log data to your project.
* <<ecs-application-logs-ingest-logs-with-agent,**{agent}:**>> A single agent for logs, metrics, security data, and threat prevention. With Fleet, you can centrally manage {agent} policies and lifecycles directly from your project.

[[ecs-application-logs-ingest-logs-with-filebeat]]
=== Ingest logs with {filebeat}

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use {filebeat} version 8.11+ for the best experience when ingesting logs with {filebeat}.
====

Follow these steps to ingest application logs with {filebeat}.

[discrete]
[[ecs-application-logs-step-1-install-filebeat]]
==== Step 1: Install {filebeat}

Install {filebeat} on the server you want to monitor by running the commands that align with your system:

include::../transclusion/observability/tab-widgets/filebeat-install/widget.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[ecs-application-logs-step-2-connect-to-your-project]]
==== Step 2: Connect to your project

Connect to your project using an API key to set up {filebeat}. Set the following information in the `filebeat.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["your-projects-elasticsearch-endpoint"]
  api_key: "id:api_key"
----

. Set the `hosts` to your project's {es} endpoint. Locate your project's endpoint by clicking the help icon (image:images/icons/help.svg[Help icon]) and selecting **Endpoints**. Add the **{es} endpoint** to your configuration.
. From **Developer tools**, run the following command to create an API key that grants `manage` permissions for the `cluster` and the `filebeat-*` indices using:
+
[source,shell]
----
POST /_security/api_key
{
  "name": "filebeat_host001",
  "role_descriptors": {
    "filebeat_writer": {
      "cluster": ["manage"],
      "index": [
        {
          "names": ["filebeat-*"],
          "privileges": ["manage"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----
+
Refer to {filebeat-ref}/beats-api-keys.html[Grant access using API keys] for more information.

[[ecs-application-logs-step-3-configure-filebeat]]
==== Step 3: Configure {filebeat}

Add the following configuration to your `filebeat.yaml` file to start collecting log data.

:ecs_logs: true
include::../transclusion/observability/tab-widgets/filebeat-logs/widget.asciidoc[]
:ecs_logs!:

[discrete]
[[ecs-application-logs-step-4-set-up-and-start-filebeat]]
==== Step 4: Set up and start {filebeat}

From the {filebeat} installation directory, set the {ref}/index-templates.html[index template] by running the command that aligns with your system:

include::../transclusion/observability/tab-widgets/filebeat-setup/widget.asciidoc[]

From the {filebeat} installation directory, start filebeat by running the command that aligns with your system:

include::../transclusion/observability/tab-widgets/filebeat-start/widget.asciidoc[]

[[ecs-application-logs-ingest-logs-with-agent]]
=== Ingest logs with {agent}

Add the custom logs integration to ingest and centrally manage your logs using {agent} and {fleet}:

[discrete]
[[ecs-application-logs-step-1-add-the-custom-logs-integration-to-your-project]]
==== Step 1: Add the custom logs integration to your project

To add the custom logs integration to your project:

. In your {observability} project, go to **Project Settings** → **Integrations**.
. Type `custom` in the search bar and select **Custom Logs**.
. Click **Install {agent}** at the bottom of the page, and follow the instructions for your system to install the {agent}. If you've already installed an {agent}, you'll be taken directly to configuring your integration.
. After installing the {agent}, click **Save and continue** to configure the integration from the **Add Custom Logs integration** page.
. Give your integration a meaningful name and description.
. Add the **Log file path**. For example, `/var/log/your-logs.log`.
. Under **Custom log file**, click **Advanced options**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/custom-logs-advanced-options.png[Screenshot of advanced options location]
. In the **Processors** text box, add the following YAML configuration to add processors that enhance your data. See {filebeat-ref}/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html[processors] to learn more.
+
[source,yaml]
----
processors:
  - add_host_metadata: ~
  - add_cloud_metadata: ~
  - add_docker_metadata: ~
  - add_kubernetes_metadata: ~
----
. Under **Custom configurations**, add the following YAML configuration to collect data.
+
[source,yaml]
----
json:
  overwrite_keys: true  <1>
  add_error_key: true  <2>
  expand_keys: true  <3>
  keys_under_root: true  <4>
fields_under_root: true  <5>
fields:
  service.name: your_service_name  <6>
  service.version: your_service_version  <6>
  service.environment: your_service_environment  <6>
----
+
<1> Values from the decoded JSON object overwrite the fields that {agent} normally adds (type, source, offset, etc.) in case of conflicts.
+
<2> {agent} adds an "error.message" and "error.type: json" key in case of JSON unmarshalling errors.
+
<3> {agent} will recursively de-dot keys in the decoded JSON, and expand them into a hierarchical object structure.
+
<4> By default, the decoded JSON is placed under a "json" key in the output document. When set to `true`, the keys are copied top level in the output document.
+
<5> When set to `true`, custom fields are stored as top-level fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields sub-dictionary.
+
<6> The `service.name` (required), `service.version` (optional), and `service.environment` (optional) of the service you're collecting logs from, used for <<correlate-application-logs-log-correlation,Log correlation>>.
. An agent policy is created that defines the data your {agent} collects. If you've previously installed an {agent} on the host you're collecting logs from, you can select the **Existing hosts** tab and use an existing agent policy.
. Click **Save and continue**.
