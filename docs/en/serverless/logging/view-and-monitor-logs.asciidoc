With **Logs Explorer**, based on Discover, you can quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
You can also customize and save your searches and place them on a dashboard.
Instead of having to log into different servers, change directories, and view individual files, all your logs are available in a single view.

Go to Logs Explorer by opening **Discover** from the navigation menu, and selecting the **Logs Explorer** tab.

The documents table in Logs Explorer functions similarly to the table in Discover.

[[observability-discover-and-explore-logs-actions-column]]
==== Actions column

The actions column provides access to additional information about your logs.

**Expand:** ({icon-expand}) Open the log details to get an in-depth look at an individual log file.

**Degraded document indicator:** ({icon-pagesSelect}) Shows if any of the document's fields were ignored when it was indexed.
Ignored fields could indicate malformed fields or other issues with your document. Use this information to investigate and determine why fields are being ignored.

**Stacktrace indicator:** ({icon-apmTrace}) Shows if the document contains stack traces.
This indicator makes it easier to navigate through your documents and know if they contain additional information in the form of stack traces.

[[observability-discover-and-explore-logs-view-log-details]]
== View log details

Click the expand icon ({icon-expand}) in the **Actions** column to get an in-depth look at an individual log file.

These details provide immediate feedback and context for what's happening and where it's happening for each log.
From here, you can quickly debug errors and investigate the services where errors have occurred.

The following actions help you filter and focus on specific fields in the log details:

* **Filter for value ({icon-plusInCircle}):** Show logs that contain the specific field value.
* **Filter out value ({icon-minusInCircle}):** Show logs that do _not_ contain the specific field value.
* **Filter for field present ({icon-filter}):** Show logs that contain the specific field.
* **Toggle column in table ({icon-listAdd}):** Add or remove a column for the field to the main Logs Explorer table.
