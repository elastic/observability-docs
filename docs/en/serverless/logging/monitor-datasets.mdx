The **Datasets** page provides an overview of your log datasets.
Use this information to get an idea of your overall log dataset quality and find datasets that contain incorrectly parsed documents.
Access the Datasets page from the main ((kib)) menu and go to **Stack Management** â†’ **Logs datasets*.

  Users with the `viewer` role can see the Datasets Quality summary. To see the Active Datasets and Estimated Data summaries, users need the `monitor` [index privilege](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) for the `logs-*-*` index.
</DocCallOut>

The quality of your datasets is based on the percentage of degraded documents in each dataset.
A degraded document in a dataset contains the [`_ignored`](((ref))/mapping-ignored-field.html) property because one or more of its fields were ignored during indexing.
Fields are ignored for a variety of reasons.
For example, when the [`ignore_malformed`](((ref))/mapping-ignored-field.html.html) parameter is set to true, if a document field contains the wrong data type, the malformed field is ignored and the rest of the document is indexed.

From the dataset table, you'll find information for each dataset such as its namespace, size, when the dataset was last active, as well as the percentage of degraded docs.
The percentage of degraded documents determines the dataset's quality according to the following scale:

* Good (<DocImage flatImage alt="Good icon" url="../images/green-dot-icon.png" />): 0% of the documents in the dataset are degraded.
* Degraded (<DocImage flatImage alt="Degraded icon" url="../images/yellow-dot-icon.png" />): Greater than 0% and up to 3% of the documents in the dataset are degraded.
* Poor (<DocImage flatImage alt="Poor icon" url="../images/red-dot-icon.png" />): Greater than 3% of the documents in the dataset are degraded.

Opening the details of a specific dataset shows the degraded documents history, a summary for the dataset, and other details that can help you determine if you need to investigate any issues.

### Investigate issues in individual datasets
To investigate issues in datasets with poor or degraded quality:

1. Find datasets with degraded documents using the **Degraded Docs** column of the datasets table.
1. Click the percentage in the **Degraded Docs** column to open the dataset in Logs Explorer.

The **Documents** table in Logs Explorer is automatically filtered to show documents that were not parsed correctly.
Under the *actions* column, you'll see the degraded document icon (<DocIcon type="indexClose" title="degraded document icon" />).

Now that you know which documents contain ignored fields, examine them more closely to find the origin of the issue.
