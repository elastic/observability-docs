Adding the `service.name` field to your logs associates them with the services that generate them.
You can use this field to view and manage logs for distributed services located on multiple hosts.
Adding a service name also associates your logs with a service in the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-services">service inventory</DocLink>.

To add a service name to your logs either:

- Use the `add_fields` processor through an integration, ((agent)) configuration, or ((filebeat)) configuration.
- Map an existing field from your data stream to the `service.name` field.

## Use the add fields processor to add a service name
For log data without a service name, use the [`add_fields` processor](((fleet-guide))/add_fields-processor.html) to add the `service.name` field.
You can add the processor in an integration's settings or in the ((agent)) or ((filebeat)) configuration.

For example, adding the `add_fields` processor to the inputs section of a standalone ((agent)) or ((filebeat)) configuration would add `your_service_name` as the `service.name` field:

```console
processors:
    - add_fields:
        target: service
        fields:
            name: your_service_name
```

Adding the `add_fields` processor to an integration settings would add `your_service_name` as the `service.name` field:

For more on defining processors, refer to [define processors](((fleet-guide))/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html).

## Map an existing field to the service name field

For logs that already have the field to use as the service name, map that field to the `service.name` field using the alias field type.
Follow these steps to update your mapping:

1. Find the field you want to map to the `service.name` field. For this example, we'll use `my_service`.
1. Update your index mapping to map `my_service` to `service.name` by adding an alias:

        ```Console
        PUT your_index/_mapping
        {
        "properties": {
            "@timestamp": {
              "type": "date"
            },
            "your_service_field": {
              "type": "keyword"
            },
            "service.name": {
              "type": "alias",
              "path": "your_service_field"
            }
        }
        }
        ```

1. Verify that the index mapping is showing the `service.name` field with the following command:

        ```console
        GET your_index/_search
        ```
