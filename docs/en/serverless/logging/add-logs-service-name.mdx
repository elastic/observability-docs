Adding the `service.name` field to your logs associates them with the services that generate them.
You can use this field to manage a specific service's logs even with distributed services located on multiple hosts.
You also need to add this field to associate you logs with a service in the service inventory.

To add the `service.name` field to your logs, do one of the following:

- Add the `service.name` field using the `add_fields` processor through an integration, ((agent)) configuration, or ((filebeat)) configuration.
- Map an existing field from your data stream to the `service.name` field.

## Use the `add_fields` processor to add `service.name`
For log data without a service name, use the [`add_fields` processor](((fleet-guide))/add_fields-processor.html) to add the `service.name` field.
You can add the processor in the following places:

- Advanced options of an integrations settings
- The ((agent)) or ((filebeat)) configuration.

For example, adding the following to the **inputs** in the standalone ((agent)) or ((filebeat)) configuration adds `yourservicename` as the `service.name` field:

```console
processors:
    - add_fields:
        target: service
        fields:
            name: yourservicename
```

Adding the following to an integration adds the `add_fields` processor:

For more on defining processors, refer to [Define processors](((fleet-guide))/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html).

## Map an existing field to the `service.name` field

For logs that already have the field to use as the service name, map that field to the `service.name` field using an [alias field type](((ref))/field-alias.html).
Follow these steps to update your mapping:

1. Locate the field you want to map to the `service.name` field. For this example, we'll use `my_service`.
1. Update your index mapping to map `my_service` to `service.name` using the following command, making sure to update `your_data_stream` to the data stream for which you're updating the mapping:

        ```Console
        PUT your_data_stream/_mapping
        {
        "properties": {
            "service": {
            "properties": {
                "name": {
                "type": "alias",
                "path": "my_service"
                }
            }
            }
        }
        }
        ```

1. Verify that the index mapping is showing the `service.name` field with the following command:

        ```console
        GET /your_data_stream/_mapping
        ```
