== Get creative with Discover

Discover allows you to quickly search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields in your data, and display your findings in a visualization.
Find **Discover** in your {obs-serverless} project's UI under *Analyze / Discover*.

Attributes and resource attributes are prefixed with `attributes.*` and `resource.attributes.*`.
You can correlate all signals with a single `resource.attributes.*`.
