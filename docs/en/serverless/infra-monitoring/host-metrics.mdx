## Hosts metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hosts**                 | Number of hosts returned by your search criteria. |

## CPU usage metrics

<DocTable columns={[
  {
    "title": "Metric",
    "width": "50%"
  },
  {
    "title": "Description",
    "width": "50%"
  }
]}>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**CPU Usage (%)**         </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      Percentage of CPU time spent in states other than Idle and IOWait, normalized by the number of CPU cores. This includes both time spent on user space and kernel space.

      100% means all CPUs of the host are busy.
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**CPU Usage - iowait (%)**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>The percentage of CPU time spent in wait (on disk).</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**CPU Usage - irq (%)**    </DocCell>
    <DocCell>The percentage of CPU time spent servicing and handling hardware interrupts.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>

    <DocCell>**CPU Usage - softirq (%)**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>The percentage of CPU time spent servicing and handling software interrupts.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**CPU Usage - steal (%)**  </DocCell>
    <DocCell>The percentage of CPU time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU while the hypervisor was servicing another processor. Available only on Unix.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**CPU Usage - system (%)** </DocCell>
    <DocCell>The percentage of CPU time spent in kernel space.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**CPU Usage - user (%)**   </DocCell>
    <DocCell>The percentage of CPU time spent in user space. On multi-core systems, you can have percentages that are greater than 100%. For example, if 3 cores are at 60% use, then the system.cpu.user.pct will be 180%.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Load (1m)**             </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      1 minute load average.

      Load average gives an indication of the number of threads that are runnable (either busy running on CPU, waiting to run, or waiting for a blocking IO operation to complete).
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Load (5m)**             </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      5 minute load average.

      Load average gives an indication of the number of threads that are runnable (either busy running on CPU, waiting to run, or waiting for a blocking IO operation to complete).
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Load (15m)**            </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      15 minute load average.

      Load average gives an indication of the number of threads that are runnable (either busy running on CPU, waiting to run, or waiting for a blocking IO operation to complete).
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Normalized Load**       </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      1 minute load average normalized by the number of CPU cores.

      Load average gives an indication of the number of threads that are runnable (either busy running on CPU, waiting to run, or waiting for a blocking IO operation to complete).

      100% means the 1 minute load average is equal to the number of CPU cores of the host.

      Taking the example of a 32 CPU cores host, if the 1 minute load average is 32, the value reported here is 100%. If the 1 minute load average is 48, the value reported here is 150%.

## Memory metrics

  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Memory Cache**                </DocCell>
    <DocCell>Memory (page) cache.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Memory Free**                 </DocCell>
    <DocCell>Total available memory.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Memory Free (excluding cache)**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>Total available memory excluding the page cache.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Memory Total**   </DocCell>
    <DocCell>Total memory capacity.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Memory Usage (%)**      </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      Percentage of main memory usage excluding page cache.

      This includes resident memory for all processes plus memory used by the kernel structures and code apart from the page cache.

      A high level indicates a situation of memory saturation for the host. For example, 100% means the main memory is entirely filled with memory that can't be reclaimed, except by swapping out.

## Log metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Log Rate**                     | Derivative of the cumulative sum of the document count scaled to a 1 second rate. This metric relies on the same indices as the logs. |

<div id="key-metrics-network"></div>

## Network metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Network Inbound (RX)**           | Number of bytes that have been received per second on the public interfaces of the hosts. |
| **Network Inbound (TX)**            | Number of bytes that have been sent per second on the public interfaces of the hosts. |

<div id="key-metrics-disk"></div>

## Disk metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Disk Latency**                 | Time spent to service disk requests. |
| **Disk Read IOPS**               | Average count of read operations from the device per second. |
| **Disk Read Throughput**         | Average number of bytes read from the device per second. |
| **Disk Usage - Available (%)**   | Percentage of disk space available. |
| **Disk Usage - Max (%)**         | Percentage of disk space used.  A high percentage indicates that a partition on a disk is running out of space. |
| **Disk Write IOPS**              | Average count of write operations from the device per second. |
| **Disk Write Throughput**        | Average number of bytes written from the device per second. |
