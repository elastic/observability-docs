{obs-serverless} allows you to visualize infrastructure metrics to help diagnose problematic spikes,
identify high resource utilization, automatically discover and track pods,
and unify your metrics with logs and APM data.

Using {agent} integrations, you can ingest and analyze metrics from servers,
Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestrations, explore and analyze application
telemetry, and more.

Use the **Inventory page** to get a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure grouped by resource type.
* <<observability-analyze-hosts>>:
Use the **Hosts** page to get a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure backed by an easy-to-use interface called Lens.

By default, the Infrastructure UI displays metrics from {es} indices that
match the `metrics-*` and `metricbeat-*` index patterns. To learn how to change
this behavior, refer to <<observability-configure-intra-settings,Configure settings>>.
