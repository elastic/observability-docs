Elastic ((observability)) allows you to visualize infrastructure metrics to help diagnose problematic spikes,
identify high resource utilization, automatically discover and track pods,
and unify your metrics with logs and APM data.

Using ((agent)) integrations, you can ingest and analyze metrics from servers,
Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestrations, explore and analyze application
telemetry, and more.

* <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/infrastructure-monitoring-required-fields" />: Learn about the fields required to display data in the Infrastructure UI.

By default, the Infrastructure UI displays metrics from ((es)) indices that
match the `metrics-*` and `metricbeat-*` index patterns. To learn how to change
this behavior, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/configure-intra-settings">Configure settings</DocLink>.
