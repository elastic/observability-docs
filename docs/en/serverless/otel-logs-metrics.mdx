<DocCallOut title="Before you begin">
   This quickstart has the following requirements and limitations:

   - The **Admin** role or higher is required to onboard system logs and metrics. To learn more, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" />.
   - Root privileges on the host are required to run the OpenTelemetry collector used in this quickstart.
   - The collectors only work on Kubernetes, Linux, and MacOS systems.
   - See the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/quickstarts/otel-logs-metrics" section="limitations">Limitations section</DocLink> for known limitations when using Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry collector.
</DocCallOut>

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn how to collect logs and metrics using the Elastic Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector,
then navigate to Logs Explorer and Discover to further analyze and explore your observability data.

## Overview

The Elastic Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector is made up of the following components:

- Receivers collect telemetry from your host.
- Processors take the data collected by receivers and modify or transform it before sending it to the exporters.
- Exporters send data to the backends or destinations.

The following sections explain the collector components for the different platforms.

### MacOS and Linux

## Collect logs and metrics using the quickstart

1. <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/create-an-observability-project">Create a new ((observability)) project</DocLink>, or open an existing one.
1. In your ((observability)) project, go to **Add Data**.
1. Select **Collect and analyze logs**, and then select **Elastic OpenTelemetry Collector**.
1. Select the appropriate platform, and copy the command that's shown.
1. Open a terminal on your host, and run the command to download and configure the OpenTelemetry collector (or download the manifest for Kubernetes).
1. Copy the command under Step 2, and run it in your terminal to start the OpenTelemetry collector.

Logs are collected from setup onward, so you won't see logs that occurred before starting the collector.
The default log path is `/var/log/*`. To update the path, modify the `otel.yml`.

Under **Visualize your data**, you'll see links to **Logs Explorer** to view your logs and **Hosts** to view your host metrics.

## Manually configure the collector
Collecting logs and host metrics with the Elastic Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector without using the quickstart requires some additional configuration.
When you download the ((agent)) package, you'll find a sample OpenTelemetry configuration file, `otel.yml`, in the package base directory.
Refer to the following sections for more on updating the `otel.yml` file to include the necessary receivers, processors, and exporters.

### Kubernetes
{/* might need some input here, not sure how/if a user would need to create a whole manifest or if we would want to recommend that. */}

### MacOS and Linux

<DocCallOut title="Before you begin">
   To manually configure the Elastic Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector, you'll need the following information:

   - **Your ((es)) endpoint**: From the Observability project help menu, select **Connection details** and copy the ((es)) endpoint.
   - **API key**: From the Observability project help menu, select **Connection details** and select the **API key** tab. Give your API key a name, select **Create API key**, and copy the new API key.
</DocCallOut>


To manually collect logs and metrics on a MacOS or Linux system using OpenTelemetry:

1. Download and extract the standalone ((agent)) for your platform. For more on downloading and extracting a standalone ((agent)), refer to the first step on [Install standalone Elastic Agents](((fleet-guide))/install-standalone-elastic-agent.html).
1. From the ((agent)) base directory, go to the `otel_samples` directory. The `platformlogs_hostmetrics.yml` file contains the receivers, processors, and exporters needed to collect logs and host metrics.
1. Copy the contents of the `platformlogs_hostmetrics.yml`.
1. From the ((agent)) base directory, open the `otel.yml` file and replace its contents with the contents of `platformlogs_hostmetrics.yml`.
1. Update the following in the OpenTelemetry configuration: {/* not sure if we want to actually set env vars for these or just replace them in the config */}
    - `file_storage.directory`: Set to the directory where you want to store you OpenTelemetry data.{/* not sure what's being stored here. */}
    - `elasticsearch.endpoint`: Set to your ((es)) endpoint you copied in the **Before you begin** section.
    - `elasticsearch.api_key`: Set to the API key you created previously in the **Before you begin** section.
1. Run the OpenTelemetry collector with the following command:
   ```console
   ./elastic-agent otel --config otel.yml
   ```

Logs are collected from setup onward, so you won't see logs that occurred before starting the collector.
The default log path is `/var/log/*`. To update the path, modify the `otel.yml`.

## Limitations

The Elastic Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector currently has the following limitations:

- `host.network.*` metrics are not present from OpenTelemetry side.
- `process.state` is not present in the OpenTelemetry host metric. It's set to a dummy value of **Unknown** in the **State** comlumn of the host processes table.
- The Elasticsearch exporter handles the metadata fields, but **Host OS version** and**Operating system** may show as "N/A" and **Host IP** may show different values.
- The CPU scraper needs to be enabled to collect the `systm.load.cores` metric, which affects the **Normalized Load** column in the **Hosts** table and the **Normalized Load** visualization on the host detailed view.

## Get value out of your data

Use Elastic ((observability)) to gain deeper insight into your data through **Logs Explorer** and the **Hosts** page.
