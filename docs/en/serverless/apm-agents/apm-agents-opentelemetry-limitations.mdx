## OpenTelemetry traces

* Traces of applications using `messaging` semantics might be wrongly displayed as `transactions` in the Applications UI, while they should be considered `spans` (see issue [#7001](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/7001)).
* Inability to see Stack traces in spans.
* Inability in APM views to view the "Time Spent by Span Type"  (see issue [#5747](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/5747)).

## OpenTelemetry metrics

* Inability to see host metrics in the **Applications** UI when using the OpenTelemetry Collector host metrics receiver (see issue [#5310](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/5310)).

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
        Even though metrics do not show up in the **Applications** view,
        the metrics are available in your Observability project and can be visualized using **Dashboards**.
        See <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-agents-opentelemetry-collect-metrics" /> for more information about visualizing OpenTelemetry metrics.

## OpenTelemetry logs

* <DocBadge template="technical preview" />  The OpenTelemetry logs intake via Elastic is in technical preview.
* The application logs data stream (`app_logs`) has dynamic mapping disabled. This means the automatic detection and mapping of new fields is disabled (see issue [#9093](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/9093)).

## OpenTelemetry Line Protocol (OTLP)

Elastic supports both the
[(OTLP/gRPC)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md#otlpgrpc) and
[(OTLP/HTTP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md#otlphttp) protocol
with ProtoBuf payload. Elastic does not yet support JSON Encoding for OTLP/HTTP.

## OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic

The [OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter#legacy-opentelemetry-collector-exporter-for-elastic)
has been deprecated and replaced by the native support of the OpenTelemetry Line Protocol in Elastic Observability (OTLP). To learn more, see [migration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter#migration).

The [OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter)
(which is different from the legacy exporter mentioned above) is not intended to be used with Elastic APM and Elastic Observability. Use <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-agents-opentelemetry-opentelemetry-native-support" text="Elastic's native OTLP support" /> instead.
