The **Services** inventory provides a quick, high-level overview of the health and general
performance of all instrumented services.

To help surface potential issues, services are sorted by their health status:
**critical** → **warning** → **healthy** → **unknown**.
Health status is powered by <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-integrate-with-machine-learning">machine learning</DocLink>
and requires anomaly detection to be enabled.

In addition to health status, active alerts for each service are prominently displayed in the service inventory table. Selecting an active alert badge brings you to the **Alerts** tab where you can learn more about the active alert and take action.

## Service groups

import Roles from '../partials/roles.mdx'

<Roles role="Editor" goal="create and manage service groups" />

<FeatureBeta feature="Service grouping" />

Group services together to build meaningful views that remove noise, simplify investigations across services,
and combine related alerts.

To create a service group:

1. In your ((observability)) project, go to **Applications** → **Services**.
1. Switch to **Service groups**.
1. Click **Create group**.
1. Specify a name, color, and description.
1. Click **Select services**.
1. Specify a [Kibana Query Language (KQL)](((kibana-ref))/kuery-query.html) query to filter services
  by one or more of the following dimensions: `agent.name`, `service.name`, `service.language.name`,
  `service.environment`, `labels.<xyz>`. Services that match the query within the last 24 hours will
  be assigned to the group.

### Examples

Not sure where to get started? Here are some sample queries you can build from:

* **Group services by environment**: To group "production" services, use `service.environment : "production"`.
* **Group services by name**: To group all services that end in "beat", use `service.name : *beat`. This will match services named "Auditbeat", "Heartbeat", "Filebeat", and so on.
