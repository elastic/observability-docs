Elastic APM agents capture different types of information from within their instrumented applications.
These are known as events, and can be spans, transactions, errors, or metrics:

* **Spans** contain information about the execution of a specific code path.
They measure from the start to the end of an activity, and they can have a parent/child
relationship with other spans.
* **Transactions** are a special kind of _span_ that have additional attributes associated with them.
They describe an event captured by an Elastic ((apm-agent)) instrumenting a service.
You can think of transactions as the highest level of work youâ€™re measuring within a service.
* **Errors** contain at least information about the original `exception` that occurred or about
a `log` created when the exception occurred. For simplicity, errors are represented by a unique ID.
* **Metrics** measure the state of a system by gathering information on a regular interval.
