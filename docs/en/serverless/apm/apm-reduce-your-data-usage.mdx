The richness and volume of APM data provides unique insights into your applications, but it can
also mean higher costs and more noise when analyzing data. There are a couple strategies you can
use to reduce your data usage while continuing to get the full value of APM data. Read more about
these strategies:

* <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-transaction-sampling" />: Reduce data storage, costs, and
noise by ingesting only a percentage of all traces that you can extrapolate from in your analysis.
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-compress-spans" />: Compress similar or identical spans to
reduce storage overhead, processing power needed, and clutter in the Applications UI.
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-stacktrace-collection" />: Reduce the stacktrace information
collected by your APM agents.
