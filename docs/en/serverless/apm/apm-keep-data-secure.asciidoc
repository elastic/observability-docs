When setting up Elastic APM, it's essential to ensure that the data collected by
APM agents is sent to Elastic securely and that sensitive data is protected.

== Data security

When setting up Elastic APM, it's essential to review all captured data carefully to ensure it doesn't contain sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or health data.

Some APM agents offer a way to manipulate or drop APM events _before_ they leave your services.
Refer to the relevant agent's documentation for more information and examples:
