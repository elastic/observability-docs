// :description: Learn about the various APM data types.
// :keywords: serverless, observability, overview

Elastic APM agents capture different types of information from within their instrumented applications.
These are known as events, and can be spans, transactions, traces, errors, or metrics.

Explain how the different data types relate to each other at a high level

Elastic APM helps you see what happens from start to finish when a request is made to an application:

* *Spans*: A span contains information about the execution of a specific code path.
  Spans are the building blocks of _transactions_ and _traces_.
* *Transactions*: A transaction describes an event captured by an Elastic
  APM agent instrumenting a service. A transaction is technically a type of span that has additional
  attributes associated with it and often contains multiple child _spans_. You can think of transactions
  as the highest level of work youâ€™re measuring within a service.
* *Traces*: A trace is a group of _transactions_ and _spans_ with a common root.
  Each trace tracks the entirety of a single request. When a trace travels through multiple services,
  it is known as a _distributed trace_.

In addition to the building blocks of traces, Elastic APM agents also capture:

* *Errors*: An error is created when something goes wrong with a request to an application.
  This event contains information to help you determine where and why an error occurred, often including in which
  _transaction_ the error occurred.
* *Metrics*: Metrics measure the state of a system by gathering information on a regular interval.

Events can contain additional metadata, which further enriches your data.
