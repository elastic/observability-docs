Elastic supports receiving traces, metrics, and logs over the
[OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).
OTLP is the default transfer protocol for OpenTelemetry and is supported natively by the managed intake service.

The managed intake service supports two OTLP communication protocols on the same port:

* OTLP/HTTP (protobuf)
* OTLP/gRPC

### OTLP/gRPC paths

| Name | Endpoint |
|---|---|
|OTLP metrics intake |`/opentelemetry.proto.collector.metrics.v1.MetricsService/Export`
|OTLP trace intake |`/opentelemetry.proto.collector.trace.v1.TraceService/Export`
|OTLP logs intake |`/opentelemetry.proto.collector.logs.v1.LogsService/Export`

### OTLP/HTTP paths

| Name | Endpoint |
|---|---|
|OTLP metrics intake |`/v1/metrics`
|OTLP trace intake |`/v1/traces`
|OTLP logs intake |`/v1/logs`
