Send APM data to Elastic with:

* **<<observability-apm-agents-elastic-apm-agents,Elastic APM agents>>:** Elastic APM agents are lightweight libraries you install in your applications and services. They automatically instrument supported technologies, and offer APIs for custom code instrumentation.
* **<<observability-apm-agents-opentelemetry,OpenTelemetry>>:** OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of telemetry data from your services and applications.

Elastic also supports instrumentation of <<observability-apm-agents-aws-lambda-functions,AWS Lambda functions>>.
