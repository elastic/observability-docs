<FeatureBeta feature="Applications UI Infrastructure" />

The **Infrastructure** tab provides information about the containers, pods, and hosts
that the selected service is linked to.

IT ops and software reliability engineers (SREs) can use this tab
to quickly find a service's underlying infrastructure resources when debugging a problem.
Knowing what infrastructure is related to a service allows you to remediate issues by restarting, killing hanging instances, changing configuration, rolling back deployments, scaling up, scaling out, and so on.
