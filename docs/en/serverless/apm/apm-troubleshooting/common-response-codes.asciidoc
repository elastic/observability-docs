[[event-too-large]]
=== HTTP 400: Event too large

APM agents communicate with the Managed intake service by sending events in an HTTP request. Each event is sent as its own line in the HTTP request body. If events are too large, you can reduce the size of the events that your APM agents send by: <<observability-apm-compress-spans,enabling span compression>> or <<observability-apm-stacktrace-collection,reducing collected stack trace information>>.
