// :keywords: serverless, observability, reference

This section lists the fields the Infrastructure UI uses to display data.
Please note that some of the fields listed here are not {ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html#_what_is_ecs[ECS fields].

[discrete]
[[observability-infrastructure-monitoring-required-fields-additional-field-details]]
== Additional field details

The `event.dataset` field is required to display data properly in some views. This field
is a combination of `metricset.module`, which is the {metricbeat} module name, and `metricset.name`,
which is the metricset name.

To determine each metric's optimal time interval, all charts use `metricset.period`.
If `metricset.period` is not available, then it falls back to 1 minute intervals.

[[base-fields]]
== Base fields

The `base` field set contains all fields which are on the top level. These fields are common across all types of events.

|===
| Field | Description | Type

| `@timestamp`
a| Date/time when the event originated.

This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the source generated the event.
If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the pipeline received the event.
Required field for all events.

Example: `May 27, 2020 @ 15:22:27.982`
| date

| `message`
a| For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.

For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

Example: `Hello World`
| text
