. Give the case a name, severity, and description.

/* To do: Need to verify that a viewer cannot be assigned to a case
(all I know is that they can _view_ the case) */

You can add users who are assigned the Editor user role (or a more permissive role) for the project.
. If you defined <<observability-case-settings-custom-fields,custom fields>>, they appear in the **Additional fields** section.
. (Optional) Under External incident management system, you can select a connector to send cases to an external system.
If you've created any connectors previously, they will be listed here.
If there are no connectors listed, you can <<observability-case-settings,create one>>.
. After you've completed all of the required fields, click **Create case**.

[TIP]
====
You can also create a case from an alert or add an alert to an existing case. From the **Alerts** page, click the **More options** {icon-boxesHorizontal} icon and choose either **Add to existing case** or **Create new case**, and select or complete the details as required.

== Add files

After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the **Files** tab:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/cases-files-tab.png[A list of files attached to a case]

// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

To download or delete the file or copy the file hash to your clipboard, open the action menu (…).
The available hash functions are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log.
To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.

[NOTE]
====
Uploaded files are also accessible under **Project settings** → **Management** → **Files**.
When you export cases as {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[saved objects], the case files are not exported.
====

You can add images and text, CSV, JSON, PDF, or ZIP files.
For the complete list, check https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/plugins/cases/common/constants/mime_types.ts[`mime_types.ts`].

.File size limits
[NOTE]
====
There is a 10 MiB size limit for images. For all other MIME types, the limit is 100 MiB.

/*

NOTE: Email notifications are not available in Observability projects yet.

## Add email notifications

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases.

To do this, add the email addresses to the monitoring email allowlist.
Follow the steps in [Send alerts by email]({cloud}/ec-watcher.html#ec-watcher-allowlist).

You do not need to configure an email connector or update
user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
used by default.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

To send a case to an external system, click the {icon-import} button in the _External incident management system_ section of the individual case page.

* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured).
* Edit the category and tags.
