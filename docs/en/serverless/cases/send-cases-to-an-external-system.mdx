If you are using an external incident management system, you can integrate Elastic Observability
cases with this system using connectors. These third-party systems are supported:

* ((ibm-r))
* ((jira)) (including ((jira)) Service Desk)
* ((sn-itsm))
* ((sn-sir))
* ((swimlane))
* ((webhook-cm))

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system. For each case, you can send the title, description, and comment when
you choose to push the case — for the **Webhook - Case Management** connector, you can also
send the status and severity fields.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
{/* TODO: Verify user roles needed to create connectors... */}
To add, modify, or delete a connector, you must have the Admin user role for the project
(or a more permissive role).
</DocCallOut>

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.

## Create a connector

1. In your ((observability)) project, go to **Cases** → **Settings**.
1. From the **Incident management system** list, select **Add new connector**.
1. Select the system to send cases to: **((sn))**, **((jira))**, **((ibm-r))**, **((swimlane))**,
    or **((webhook-cm))**.

1. Enter your required settings. For connector configuration details, refer to:
   -  [((ibm-r)) connector](((kibana-ref))/resilient-action-type.html)
   -  [((jira)) connector](((kibana-ref))/jira-action-type.html)
   -  [((sn-itsm)) connector](((kibana-ref))/servicenow-action-type.html)
   -  [((sn-sir)) connector](((kibana-ref))/servicenow-sir-action-type.html)
   -  [((swimlane)) connector](((kibana-ref))/swimlane-action-type.html)
   -  [((webhook-cm)) connector](((kibana-ref))/cases-webhook-action-type.html)

   {/* Should we be linking out to kibana docs for this info? */}

1. Click **Save**.

## Edit a connector

You can create additional connectors, update existing connectors, and change the connector used to send cases to external systems.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also configure which connector is used for each case individually. Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/create-a-new-case"/>.
</DocCallOut>

To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems:

1. Go to **Cases** → **Settings**.
1. Select the required connector from the **Incident management system** list.

To update an existing connector:

1. Click **Update \<connector name>**.
1. Update the connector fields as required.

## Sending and closing cases

To send a case to an external system, click the **Push as \<connector name> incident**  <DocIcon type="importAction" title="push" /> button from the individual case page.
This information is not sent automatically — if you make further changes to the shared case fields, you should push the case again.

If you close cases in your external incident management system, the cases will remain open in Elastic Observability until you close them
manually (the information is only sent in one direction).

To close cases when they are sent to an external system, select
**Automatically close cases when pushing new incident to external system** from **Cases** → **Settings**.
