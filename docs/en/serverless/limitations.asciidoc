Currently, the maximum ingestion rate for the Managed Intake Service (APM and OpenTelemetry ingest) is 11.5 MB/s of uncompressed data (roughly 1TB/d uncompressed equivalent). Ingestion at a higher rate may experience rate limiting or ingest failures.

If you believe you are experiencing rate limiting or other ingest-based failures,
please {estc-welcome}/get-support-help.html[open a support case] for assistance.
