If you <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/synthetics-get-started-project">set up the monitor using a Synthetics project</DocLink>,
you'll update the monitor in the Synthetics project and then `push` changes to your Observability project.

For lightweight monitors, make changes to the YAML file.

For browser monitors, you can update the configuration of one or more monitors:

* To update the configuration of an individual monitor, edit the journey directly in
    the JavaScript or TypeScript files, specifically the options in `monitor.use`.
* To update the configuration of _all_ monitors in a Synthetics project, edit the
    <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/synthetics-configuration" section="monitor">global synthetics configuration file</DocLink>.

To update the journey that a browser monitor runs, edit the journey code directly and
<DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/synthetics-create-test" section="test-locally">test the updated journey locally</DocLink> to make sure it's valid.

After making changes to the monitors, run the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/synthetics-command-reference" section="elasticsynthetics-push">`push` command</DocLink>
to replace the existing monitors with new monitors using the updated
configuration or journey code.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Updates are linked to a monitor's `id`. To update a monitor you must keep its `id` the same.
