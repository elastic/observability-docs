If you <<synthetics-get-started-project,set up the monitor using a Synthetics project>>,
you'll delete the monitor from the Synthetics project and push changes.

For lightweight monitors, delete the monitor from the YAML file.

For browser monitors, delete the full journey from the JavaScript or TypeScript file.

Then, run the <<elastic-synthetics-push-command,`push` command>>.
The monitor associated with that journey that existed in your Observability project will be deleted.
