`id` (`string`)::
A unique identifier for this monitor.

[[monitor-name]]`name` (`string`)::
A human readable name for the monitor.

[[monitor-tags]]`tags` (`Array<string>`)::
A list of tags that will be sent with the monitor event. Tags are displayed in the Synthetics UI and allow you to search monitors by tag.

`schedule` (`number`)::
The interval (in minutes) at which the monitor should run.

`enabled` (`boolean`)::
Enable or disable the monitor from running without deleting and recreating it.

`locations` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/locations/public-locations.ts#L28-L37[`Array<SyntheticsLocationsType>`])::
Where to deploy the monitor. Monitors can be deployed in multiple locations so that you can detect differences in availability and response times across those locations.
+
To list available locations you can:
+
* Run the <<elastic-synthetics-locations-command,`elastic-synthetics locations` command>>.
* Go to **Synthetics** → **Management** and click **Create monitor**.
Locations will be listed in _Locations_.

`privateLocations` (`Array<string>`)::
The <<observability-synthetics-private-location,{private-location}s>> to which the monitors will be deployed. These {private-location}s refer to locations hosted and managed by you, whereas
`locations` are hosted by Elastic. You can specify a {private-location} using the location's name.
+
To list available {private-location}s you can:
+
* Run the <<elastic-synthetics-locations-command,`elastic-synthetics locations` command>>
with the URL for the Observability project from which to fetch available locations.
* Go to **Synthetics** → **Management** and click **Create monitor**.
{private-location}s will be listed in _Locations_.

`throttling` (`boolean` | https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/common_types.ts#L194-L198[`ThrottlingOptions`])::
Control the monitor's download speeds, upload speeds, and latency to simulate your application's behavior on slower or laggier networks. Set to `false` to disable throttling altogether.

`screenshot` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/common_types.ts#L192[`ScreenshotOptions`])::
Control whether or not to capture screenshots. Options include `'on'`, `'off'`, or `'only-on-failure'`.

`alert.status.enabled` (`boolean`)::
Enable or disable monitor status alerts. Read more about alerts in <<synthetics-settings-alerting,Alerting>>.

`retestOnFailure` (`boolean`)::
Enable or disable retesting when a monitor fails. Default is `true`.
+
By default, monitors are automatically retested if the monitor goes from "up" to "down".
If the result of the retest is also "down", an error will be created, and if configured, an alert sent.
Then the monitor will resume running according to the defined schedule.
+
Using `retestOnFailure` can reduce noise related to transient problems.

`fields` (`object`)::
A list of key-value pairs that will be sent with each monitor event.
The `fields` are appended to {es} documents as `labels`,
and those labels are displayed in {kib} in the _Monitor details_ panel in the
<<synthetics-analyze-individual-monitors-overview,individual monitor's _Overview_ tab>>.
+
For example:
+
[source,js]
----
fields: {
  foo: 'bar',
  team: 'synthetics',
}
