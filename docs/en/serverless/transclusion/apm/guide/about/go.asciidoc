**Elastic APM Go agent**

The Elastic APM Go agent enables you to trace the execution of operations in your https://golang.org/[Go]
applications.
It has built-in support for popular frameworks and toolkits,
like http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/[Gorilla] and https://gin-gonic.com/[Gin],
as well as support for instrumenting Go's built-in https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/[net/http],
https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/[database/sql] drivers.

The Agent includes instrumentation modules for supported technologies,
each providing middleware or wrappers for recording interesting events, such as incoming HTTP requests, outgoing HTTP requests, and database queries.

To collect data about incoming HTTP requests, install router middleware for one of the supported web frameworks.
Incoming requests will be recorded as transactions, along with any related panics or errors.

To collect data for outgoing HTTP requests, instrument an `http.Client` or `http.Transport` using `module/apmhttp`.
To collect data about database queries, use `module/apmsql`,
which provides instrumentation for well-known database drivers.

In order to connect transactions with related spans and errors, and propagate traces between services (distributed tracing),
the agent relies on Go's built-in https://golang.org/pkg/context/[context] package:
transactions and spans are stored in context objects.
For example, for incoming HTTP requests, in-flight trace data will be recorded in the `context` object accessible through
https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request.Context[net/http.Context].

In addition to capturing events like those mentioned here,
the agent also collects system and application metrics at regular intervals.
This collection happens in a background goroutine that is automatically started when the agent is initialized.
