**Elastic APM Python agent**

The Elastic APM Python agent has built-in support for Django and Flask performance metrics and error logging, as well as generic support of other WSGI frameworks for error logging.

It instruments your application to collect APM events in a few different ways:

To collect data about incoming requests and background tasks, the Agent integrates with supported technologies to make use of hooks and signals provided by the framework.
These framework integrations require limited code changes in your application.

To collect data from database drivers, HTTP libraries, and so on,
Elastic APM agents instrument certain functions and methods in these libraries.
Instrumentations are set up automatically and do not require any code changes.

In addition to APM and error data,
the Python agent also collects system and application metrics in regular intervals.
This collection happens in a background thread that is started by the agent.
