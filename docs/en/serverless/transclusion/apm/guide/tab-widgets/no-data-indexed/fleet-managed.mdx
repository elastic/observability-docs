**Are the URL and API key correct?**

Double check that the intake URL and API key are correct in your APM agent configuration.
Reference the relevant [((apm-agent)) documentation](((apm-agents-ref))/index.html) for details on how to set these configuration variables.

To create a new API key, see <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-keep-data-secure" section="create-a-new-api-key" text="Create a new API key" />.

If you see requests coming through the managed intake service but they are not accepted (a response code other than `202`),
see <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-troubleshooting" section="common-response-codes">managed intake service response codes</DocLink> to narrow down the possible causes.

**Are there instrumentation gaps?**

APM agents provide auto-instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries.
If the ((apm-agent)) is not auto-instrumenting something that you were expecting, data won't be sent to Elastic.
Reference the relevant [((apm-agent)) documentation](((apm-agents-ref))/index.html) for details on what is automatically instrumented.
