**Are the URL and API key correct?**

Double check that the intake URL and API key are correct in your APM agent configuration.
Reference the relevant {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[{apm-agent} documentation] for details on how to set these configuration variables.

To create a new API key, see <<apm-keep-data-secure-create-a-new-api-key,Create a new API key>>.

If you see requests coming through the managed intake service but they are not accepted (a response code other than `202`),
see <<apm-troubleshooting-common-response-codes,managed intake service response codes>> to narrow down the possible causes.

**Are there instrumentation gaps?**

APM agents provide auto-instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries.
If the {apm-agent} is not auto-instrumenting something that you were expecting, data won't be sent to Elastic.
Reference the relevant {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[{apm-agent} documentation] for details on what is automatically instrumented.
