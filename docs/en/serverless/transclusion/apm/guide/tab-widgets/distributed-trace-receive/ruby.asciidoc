Start a new transaction or span as a child of the incoming transaction or span with
{apm-ruby-ref}/api.html#api-agent-with_transaction[`with_transaction`] or
{apm-ruby-ref}/api.html#api-agent-with_span[`with_span`].

Example:

[source,ruby]
----
# env being a Rack env
context = ElasticAPM::TraceContext.parse(env: env)   <1>

ElasticAPM.with_transaction("Do things", trace_context: context) do   <2>
  ElasticAPM.with_span("Do nested thing", trace_context: context) do   <3>
  end
end
----

<1> Parse the incoming `TraceContext`

<2> Create a transaction as a child of the incoming `TraceContext`

<3> Create a span as a child of the newly created transaction. `trace_context` is optional here,
as spans are automatically created as a child of their parent's transaction's `TraceContext` when none is passed.
