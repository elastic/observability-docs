Start a new transaction or span as a child of the incoming transaction or span with
[`with_transaction`](((apm-ruby-ref))/api.html#api-agent-with_transaction) or
[`with_span`](((apm-ruby-ref))/api.html#api-agent-with_span).

Example:

```ruby
# env being a Rack env
context = ElasticAPM::TraceContext.parse(env: env)  [^1]

ElasticAPM.with_transaction("Do things", trace_context: context) do  [^2]
  ElasticAPM.with_span("Do nested thing", trace_context: context) do  [^3]
  end
end
```
[^1]: Parse the incoming `TraceContext`
[^2]: Create a transaction as a child of the incoming `TraceContext`
[^3]: Create a span as a child of the newly created transaction. `trace_context` is optional here,
as spans are automatically created as a child of their parent's transaction's `TraceContext` when none is passed.
