1. Decode and store the `traceparent` in the receiving service.

1. Pass in the `traceparent` as the `childOf` option to manually start a new transaction
    as a child of the received `traceparent` with
    [`apm.startTransaction()`](((apm-node-ref))/agent-api.html#apm-start-transaction).

<br />

Example receiving a `traceparent` over raw UDP:

```js
const traceparent = readTraceparentFromUDPPacket()  [^1]
agent.startTransaction('my-service-b-transaction', { childOf: traceparent })  [^2]
```
[^1]: Read the `traceparent` from the incoming request.
[^2]: Use the `traceparent` to initialize a new transaction that is a child of the original `traceparent`.
