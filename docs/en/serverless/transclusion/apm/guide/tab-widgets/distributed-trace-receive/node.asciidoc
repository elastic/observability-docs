. Decode and store the `traceparent` in the receiving service.
. Pass in the `traceparent` as the `childOf` option to manually start a new transaction
as a child of the received `traceparent` with
{apm-node-ref}/agent-api.html#apm-start-transaction[`apm.startTransaction()`].

Example receiving a `traceparent` over raw UDP:

[source,js]
----
const traceparent = readTraceparentFromUDPPacket()   <1>
agent.startTransaction('my-service-b-transaction', { childOf: traceparent })   <2>
----

<1> Read the `traceparent` from the incoming request.

<2> Use the `traceparent` to initialize a new transaction that is a child of the original `traceparent`.
