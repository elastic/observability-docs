Django and Flask are two of several frameworks that the Elastic APM Python Agent
supports. For a complete list of supported technologies, refer to the
[Elastic APM Python Agent documentation](((apm-py-ref))/supported-technologies.html).

_Django_

```python
$ pip install elastic-apm
```

**1. Install the ((apm-agent))**

Install the ((apm-agent)) for Python as a dependency.

```python
$ pip install elastic-apm
```

**2. Configure the ((apm-agent))**

Agents are libraries that run inside of your application process.
APM services are created programmatically based on the `SERVICE_NAME`.

```python
# Add the agent to the installed apps
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  'elasticapm.contrib.django',
  # ...
)

ELASTIC_APM = {
  # Set required service name. Allowed characters:
  # a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space
  'SERVICE_NAME': '',

  # Use if APM integration requires a token
  'SECRET_TOKEN': '',

  # Set custom APM integration host and port (default: http://localhost:8200)
  'SERVER_URL': '',
}

# To send performance metrics, add our tracing middleware:
MIDDLEWARE = (
  'elasticapm.contrib.django.middleware.TracingMiddleware',
  #...
)
```

_Flask_

**1. Install the ((apm-agent))**

Install the ((apm-agent)) for Python as a dependency.

```python
$ pip install elastic-apm[flask]
```

**2. Configure the ((apm-agent))**

Agents are libraries that run inside of your application process.
APM services are created programmatically based on the `SERVICE_NAME`.

```python
# initialize using environment variables
from elasticapm.contrib.flask import ElasticAPM
app = Flask(__name__)
apm = ElasticAPM(app)

# or configure to use ELASTIC_APM in your application settings
from elasticapm.contrib.flask import ElasticAPM
app.config['ELASTIC_APM'] = {
  # Set required service name. Allowed characters:
  # a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space
  'SERVICE_NAME': '',

  # Use if APM integration requires a token
  'SECRET_TOKEN': '',

  # Set custom APM integration host and port (default: http://localhost:8200)
  'SERVER_URL': '',
}

apm = ElasticAPM(app)
```
