The failed transaction rate represents the percentage of failed transactions from the perspective of the selected service.
It's useful for visualizing unexpected increases, decreases, or irregular patterns in a service's transactions.

[TIP]
====
HTTP **transactions** from the HTTP server perspective do not consider a `4xx` status code (client error) as a failure
because the failure was caused by the caller, not the HTTP server. Thus, `event.outcome=success` and there will be no increase in failed transaction rate.

HTTP **spans** from the client perspective however, are considered failures if the HTTP status code is â‰¥ 400.
These spans will set `event.outcome=failure` and increase the failed transaction rate.

If there is no HTTP status, both transactions and spans are considered successful unless an error is reported.
