The **Throughput** chart visualizes the average number of transactions per minute for the selected service.

The **Transactions** table displays a list of _transaction groups_ for the
selected service and includes the latency, traffic, error rate, and the impact for each transaction.
Transactions that share the same name are grouped, and only one entry is displayed for each group.

By default, transaction groups are sorted by _Impact_ to show the most used and slowest endpoints in your
service. If there is a particular endpoint you are interested in, click **View transactions** to view a
list of similar transactions on the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-transactions">transactions overview</DocLink> page.
