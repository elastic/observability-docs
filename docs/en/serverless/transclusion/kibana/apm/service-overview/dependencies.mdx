The **Dependencies** table displays a list of downstream services or external connections relevant
to the service at the selected time range. The table displays latency, throughput, failed transaction rate, and the impact of
each dependency. By default, dependencies are sorted by _Impact_ to show the most used and the slowest dependency.
If there is a particular dependency you are interested in, click **<DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/apm-dependencies">View dependencies</DocLink>** to learn more about it.
