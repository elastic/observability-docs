[NOTE]
====
You'll be running {filebeat} as root, so you need to change ownership of the configuration file and any configurations enabled in the `modules.d` directory, or run {filebeat} with `--strict.perms=false` specified. Refer to {beats-ref}/config-file-permissions.html[Config file ownership and permissions].
