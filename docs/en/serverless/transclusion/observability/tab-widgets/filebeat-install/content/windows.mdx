1. Extract the contents of the zip file into `C:\Program Files`.

1. Rename the `filebeat-((version))-windows-x86_64` directory to `((filebeat))`.

1. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click the PowerShell icon
and select **Run As Administrator**).

1. From the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to install
((filebeat)) as a Windows service:

    ```powershell
    PS > cd 'C:\Program Files\((filebeat))'
