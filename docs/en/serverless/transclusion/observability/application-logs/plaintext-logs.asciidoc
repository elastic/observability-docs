Use {filebeat} to parse and ingest raw, plain-text application logs.

**Requirements**

* (Optional) Elastic APM agent for your programming language (for log correlation)
* Raw, plain-text application logs stored on the file system
* {filebeat} configured to monitor and capture application logs

**Pros**

* All programming languages/frameworks are supported
* Existing application logs can be ingested
* Does not require modification of the application or its configuration, unless log correlation is required

**Cons**

* Must parse application logs to be usefulâ€”meaning writing and maintaining Grok patterns and spending CPU cycles on parsing
* Parsing is tied to the application log format, meaning it can differ per application and needs to be maintained over time
* Log correlation requires modifying the application log format and inject IDs in log messages
