Elastic APM agents can automatically reformat application logs to Elastic Common Schema (ECS) format
without needing to add an ECS logger dependency or modify the application.

**Requirements**

* The Elastic APM agent for your programming language
* {filebeat} configured to monitor and capture application logs

**Pros**

All the benefits of using ECS logging, without having to modify the application or its configuration:

* Simplicity: no manual parsing with {filebeat}, and a configuration can be reused across applications
* Decently human-readable JSON structure
* APM log correlation

**Cons**

* Requires an Elastic APM agent
* Not all APM agents support this feature

**Supported APM agents/languages**

* Ruby
* Python
* Java
