Elastic Common Schema (ECS) loggers format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON,
removing the need to manually parse logs.

**Requirements**

* (Optional) Elastic APM agent for your programming language (for log correlation)
* The Elastic ECS logger for your language or framework
* {filebeat} configured to monitor and capture application logs

**Pros**

* Popular logging frameworks supported
* Simplicity: no manual parsing with {filebeat}, and a configuration can be reused across applications
* Decently human-readable JSON structure
* APM log correlation
* Resilient in case of outages

**Cons**

* Not all frameworks are supported
* Requires modification of the application and its log configuration
