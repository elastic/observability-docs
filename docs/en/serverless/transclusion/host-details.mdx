<DocAccordion buttonContent="Overview">

The **Overview** tab displays key metrics about the selected host, such as CPU usage,
normalized load, memory usage, and max disk usage.

Change the time range to view metrics over a specific period of time.

Expand each section to view more detail related to the selected host, such as metadata,
active alerts, services detected on the host, and metrics.

Hover over a specific time period on a chart to compare the various metrics at that given time.

Click **Show all** to drill down into related data.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Metadata">

The **Metadata** tab lists all the meta information relating to the host,
including host, cloud, and agent information.

This information can help when investigating events—for example,
when filtering by operating system or architecture.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Metrics">

The **Metrics** tab shows host metrics organized by type and is more complete than the view available in the *Overview* tab.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Processes">

The **Processes** tab lists the total number of processes (`system.process.summary.total`) running on the host,
along with the total number of processes in these various states:

* Running (`system.process.summary.running`)
* Sleeping (`system.process.summary.sleeping`)
* Stopped (`system.process.summary.stopped`)
* Idle (`system.process.summary.idle`)
* Dead (`system.process.summary.dead`)
* Zombie (`system.process.summary.zombie`)
* Unknown (`system.process.summary.unknown`)

The processes listed in the **Top processes** table are based on an aggregation of the top CPU and the top memory consuming processes.
The number of top processes is controlled by `process.include_top_n.by_cpu` and `process.include_top_n.by_memory`.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Command** | Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path to the executable, and all the arguments (`system.process.cmdline`). |
| **PID** | Process id (`process.pid`). |
| **User** | User name (`user.name`). |
| **CPU** | The percentage of CPU time spent by the process since the last event (`system.process.cpu.total.pct`). |
| **Time** | The time the process started (`system.process.cpu.start_time`).  |
| **Memory** | The percentage of memory (`system.process.memory.rss.pct`) the process occupied in main memory (RAM).  |
| **State** | The current state of the process and the total number of processes (`system.process.state`). Expected values are: `running`, `sleeping`, `dead`, `stopped`, `idle`, `zombie`, and `unknown`. |

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Logs">

The **Logs** tab displays logs relating to the host that you have selected. By default, the logs tab displays the following columns.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Timestamp** | The timestamp of the log entry from the `timestamp` field.  |
| **Message** | The message extracted from the document. The content of this field depends on the type of log message. If no special log message type is detected, the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](((ecs-ref))/ecs-base.html) base field, `message`, is used. |

To view the logs in the ((logs-app)) for a detailed analysis, click **Open in Logs**.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Anomalies">

The **Anomalies** tab displays a list of each single metric ((anomaly-detect)) job for the specific host. By default, anomaly
jobs are sorted by time, showing the most recent jobs first.

Along with the name of each anomaly job, detected anomalies with a severity score equal to 50 or higher are listed. These
scores represent a severity of "warning" or higher in the selected time period. The **summary** value represents the increase between
the actual value and the expected ("typical") value of the host metric in the anomaly record result.

To drill down and analyze the metric anomaly, select **Actions** → **Open in Anomaly Explorer**.
You can also select **Actions** → **Show in Inventory** to view the host Inventory page, filtered by the specific metric.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Osquery">

<DocCallOut title="Required role">
One of the following roles is required to use Osquery.

* **Admin:** Has full access to project configuration, including the ability to install, manage, and run Osquery queries through ((agent)). This role supports both ad hoc (live) queries and scheduled queries against monitored hosts. Admins can view and analyze the results directly in ((es)).
* **Editor:** Has limited access. Editors can run pre-configured queries, but may have restricted permissions for setting up and scheduling new queries, especially queries that require broader access or permissions adjustments.
* **Viewer**: Has read-only access to data, including viewing Osquery results if configured by a user with higher permissions. Viewers cannot initiate or schedule Osquery queries themselves.

To learn more about roles, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" />.
</DocCallOut>

<DocCallOut title="Important">
You must have an active [((agent))](((fleet-guide))/elastic-agent-installation.html) with an assigned agent policy
that includes the [Osquery Manager](((integrations-docs))/osquery_manager.html) integration.
</DocCallOut>

The **Osquery** tab allows you to build SQL statements to query your host data.
You can create and run live or saved queries against
the ((agent)). Osquery results are stored in ((es))
so that you can use the ((stack)) to search, analyze, and
visualize your host metrics. To create saved queries and add scheduled query groups,
refer to [Osquery](((kibana-ref))/osquery.html).

To view more information about the query, click the **Status** tab. A query status can result in
`success`, `error` (along with an error message), or `pending` (if the ((agent)) is offline).

Other options include:

* View in Discover to search, filter, and view information about the structure of host metric fields. To learn more, refer to [Discover](((kibana-ref))/discover.html).
* View in Lens to create visualizations based on your host metric fields. To learn more, refer to [Lens](((kibana-ref))/lens.html).
* View the results in full screen mode.
* Add, remove, reorder, and resize columns.
* Sort field names in ascending or descending order.
