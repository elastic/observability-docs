The DEB package includes a service unit for Linux systems with systemd. On these
systems, you can manage ((agent)) by using the usual systemd commands.

{/* tag::start-command[] */}
Use `systemctl` to start the agent:

```shell
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent
```

Otherwise, use:

```shell
sudo service elastic-agent start
```
{/* end::start-command[] */}
