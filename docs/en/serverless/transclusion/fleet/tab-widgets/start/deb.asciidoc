The DEB package includes a service unit for Linux systems with systemd. On these
systems, you can manage {agent} by using the usual systemd commands.

// tag::start-command[]

Use `systemctl` to start the agent:

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent
----

Otherwise, use:

[source,shell]
----
sudo service elastic-agent start
----

// end::start-command[]
