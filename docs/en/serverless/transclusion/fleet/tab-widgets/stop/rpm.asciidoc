The RPM package includes a service unit for Linux systems with systemd. On these
systems, you can manage {agent} by using the usual systemd commands.

// tag::stop-command[]

Use `systemctl` to stop the agent:

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl stop elastic-agent
----

Otherwise, use:

[source,shell]
----
sudo service elastic-agent stop
----

[NOTE]
====
{agent} will restart automatically if the system is rebooted.
====

// end::stop-command[]
