The RPM package includes a service unit for Linux systems with systemd. On these
systems, you can manage ((agent)) by using the usual systemd commands.

{/* tag::stop-command[] */}
Use `systemctl` to stop the agent:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop elastic-agent
```

Otherwise, use:

```shell
sudo service elastic-agent stop
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">
((agent)) will restart automatically if the system is rebooted.
</DocCallOut>

{/* end::stop-command[] */}
