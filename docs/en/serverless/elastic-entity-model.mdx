The Elastic Entity Model is a data model (and related entity indices),
an Entity Discovery Framework ([transforms](((ref))/transforms.html) and [Ingest Pipelines](((ref))/ingest.html) that read from signal indices and write data to entity indices),
and a set of management APIs that empower entity-centric Elastic solution features and workflows.

In the context of Elastic Observability,
an Entity can be defined as “an object of interest that can be associated with produced telemetry and can be identified as unique.”
Note that this definition is intentionally closely aligned to the work of the [OpenTelemetry Entities SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/entities/0256-entities-data-model.md#data-model).
Examples of entities include (but are not limited to) services, hosts, and containers.

The concept of an Entity is important as a means to unify observability signals based on the underlying entity that the signals describe.

## Enabling Elastic Entity Model

During Technical Preview,
the Elastic Entity Model will be enabled when a user enables the entity-centric service inventory Technical Preview feature as described in <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/new-experience-services" />.

The user enabling the technical preview feature must have the following security privileges:

{/* TODO: Reformat the following list to make it easier to scan. */}

- One of the following [cluster privileges](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) (for API key creation)
    - `manage_security`, `manage_api_key`, `manage_own_api_key`
- All of the following privileges (for managing elasticsearch resources)
    - [Indices privileges](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices)
        - names: [`entities*`], privileges: [`create_index`, `index`, `create_doc`, `auto_configure`, `read`]
        - names: [`logs-*`, `filebeat*`, `metrics-*`, `metricbeat*`, `traces-*`, `entities*`], privileges: [`read`, `view_index_metadata`],
    - [Cluster privileges](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster)
        - `manage_transform`, `monitor_transform`, `manage_ingest_pipelines`, `monitor`
    - [Application privileges](((ref))/security-privileges.html#application-privileges)
        - application: `kibana-.kibana`, privileges: [`saved_object:entity-definition/*`, `saved_object:entity-discovery-api-key/*`], resources: [*]

## Disabling Elastic Entity Model

The Elastic Entity Model will become disabled when a user* performs the following steps: perform the following steps:

- Using the Dev Console, issue the command `DELETE kbn:/internal/entities/managed/enablement`

The user disabling the Elastic Entity Model must have the following security privileges:

{/* TODO: Reformat the following list to make it easier to scan. */}

- One of the following cluster privileges (for invalidating the API key)
    - `manage_security`, `manage_api_key`
- All of the following privileges (for deleting elasticsearch resources)
    - Cluster privileges
        - `manage_transform`, `manage_ingest_pipelines`
    - Application privileges
        - application: `kibana-.kibana`, privileges: [`saved_object:entity-definition/delete`, `saved_object:entity-discovery-api-key/delete`], resources: [*]

<DocCallOut title="Notes">
    - The Elastic Entity Model currently supports the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/new-experience-services">new service inventory experience</DocLink> limited to service-based entities (as identified by `service.name`) located in data identified by `logs-*` and `trace-*` index patterns
    - During Technical Preview, the Entity Definition Framework components are not enabled by default
