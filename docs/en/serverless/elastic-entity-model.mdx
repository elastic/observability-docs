The Elastic Entity Model consists of:

- a data model and related entity indices
- an Entity Discovery Framework, which consists of [transforms](((ref))/transforms.html) and [Ingest pipelines](((ref))/ingest.html) that read from signal indices and write data to entity indices
- a set of management APIs that empower entity-centric Elastic solution features and workflows

In Elastic Observability,
an _entity_ is an object of interest that can be associated with produced telemetry and identified as unique.
Note that this definition is intentionally closely aligned to the work of the [OpenTelemetry Entities SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/entities/0256-entities-data-model.md#data-model).
Examples of entities include (but are not limited to) services, hosts, and containers.

The concept of an entity is important as a means to unify observability signals based on the underlying entity that the signals describe.

<DocCallOut title="Notes">
    - The Elastic Entity Model currently supports the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/inventory">new inventory experience</DocLink> limited to service, host, and container entities.
    - During Technical Preview, Entity Discovery Framework components are not enabled by default.

## Enable the Elastic Entity Model

<Roles role="Admin" goal="enable the Elastic Entity Model" />

You can enable the Elastic Entity Model from the new <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/inventory">Inventory</DocLink>. If already enabled, you will not be prompted to enable the Elastic Entity Model.    


## Disable the Elastic Entity Model

<Roles role="Admin" goal="enable the Elastic Entity Model" />

From the Dev Console, run the command: `DELETE kbn:/internal/entities/managed/enablement`

## Limitations

* [Cross-cluster search (CCS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-cross-cluster-search.html) is not supported. EEM cannot leverage data stored on a remote cluster.
* Services are only detected from documents where `service.name` is detected in index patterns that match either `logs-*` or `apm-*`.
