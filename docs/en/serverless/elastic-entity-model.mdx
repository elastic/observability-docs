The Elastic Entity Model consists of:

- a data model and related entity indices
- an Entity Discovery Framework, which consists of [transforms](((ref))/transforms.html) and [Ingest pipelines](((ref))/ingest.html) that read from signal indices and write data to entity indices
- a set of management APIs that empower entity-centric Elastic solution features and workflows

In the context of Elastic Observability,
an _entity_ is an object of interest that can be associated with produced telemetry and identified as unique.
Note that this definition is intentionally closely aligned to the work of the [OpenTelemetry Entities SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/entities/0256-entities-data-model.md#data-model).
Examples of entities include (but are not limited to) services, hosts, and containers.

The concept of an entity is important as a means to unify observability signals based on the underlying entity that the signals describe.

## Enable or disable the Elastic Entity Model

<Roles role="Admin" goal="enable or disable the Elastic Entity Model" />


During Technical Preview,
the Elastic Entity Model is enabled when you turn on the entity-centric service inventory described in <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/new-experience-services" />.

**To disable the Elastic Entity Model:**

- From the Dev Console, run the command: `DELETE kbn:/internal/entities/managed/enablement`

<DocCallOut title="Notes">
    - The Elastic Entity Model currently supports the <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/new-experience-services">new service inventory experience</DocLink> limited to service-based entities (as identified by `service.name`) located in data identified by `logs-*` and `trace-*` index patterns
    - During Technical Preview, Entity Discovery Framework components are not enabled by default
