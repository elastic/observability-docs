== What is Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose?

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that reliably captures, transforms, and delivers streaming data to data lakes, data stores, and analytics services.

// todo: add link to pricing page
Using Firehose to send your data to Elastic means you have no agents to deploy, lambdas to configure, or Beats to manage. Pricing is simple, predictable, and typically more cost-effective than other data ingest solutions. Additionally, auto-scaling capability is built in, and the service is designed to handle high-volume use cases.

The overall architecture is shown below.
