{fleet} supports integration installation through direct upload as a means to support integration developers
or users who have created custom integrations that they don't want to commit upstream back to the https://github.com/elastic/integrations[Elastic Integrations repository].

Direct upload can also be useful in air-gapped environments,
by providing a way to update integrations without needing to update a self-hosted package registry.
