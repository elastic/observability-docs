= Quick start: Sample integration

NOTE: This quick start is designed for users familiar with the {stack}. If you're new to Elastic, <<build-a-new-integration>> provides an in-depth look at creating a new integration.

This is a quick guide on how you can build your own integration package and upload it to Kibana.

Follow these steps to create an integration package named `sample` and then add a `logs` dataset. The same procedure can be used for a `metrics` dataset, however for your first integration package `logs` is a bit simpler because a custom input is not required.

[[qs-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

You'll need to have a few requirements in place to run this tutorial:

* link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package[elastic-package] installed on your machine. This is a command line tool, written in Go, used for developing Elastic packages. It can help you lint, format, test, build, and promote your packages. Setup instructions can be found in the elastic-package repository readme.

* A link:https://github.com/[GitHub repository] where you can upload your integration package.

* link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] set up and running on your machine.

[discrete]
[[qs-create-package]]
== Step 1: Create the package

. To start, from inside a Git repository, run the `elastic-package create package` command. This will launch a wizard that will prompt you for some details, and will then build an empty package with all the necessary parts:
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package create package
----

. Respond to prompts as follows:
+
* Package type: `integration`
* Package name: `sample`
* Version: `0.0.1`
* License: `Elastic-2.0`
* Package title: `My sample package`
* Description: `My first integrations package to collect logs`
* Categories: `custom`
* Kibana version constraint: `^8.12.2`
* Required Elastic subscription: `basic`
* Github owner: `<your github name>`
* Owner type: `elastic`

. After entering the details, the command should return a confirmation that your package has been created.

. Change into the new `sample` package directory. 
+
[source,console]
----
cd sample
----

. Validate that the new integration package was created correctly.

.. Check the linting rules for the package
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package lint
----

.. Format the pacakge to fix linting
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package lint
----

.. Build a `.zip` file out of the package assets
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package build
----

.. If you prefer, you can also run the three previous commands as a single batch:
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package check
----

[discrete]
[[qs-test-upload]]
== Step 2: Upload the package to Kibana

. To test that your package can be installed into Kibana, a cluster needs to spin up. For this step you to have a running Docker setup. Run the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package stack up --version=8.12.2 -v
----
+
This spins up a cluster with the version 8.12.2 of the {stack}. The cluster can be accessed in your browser at https://localhost:5601 with username `elastic` and password `changeme`.
+
[NOTE] 
==== 
* If you want to update to the latest {stack} version, run `elastic-package stack update --version=8.12.2 -v`.
* You can also install the package directly into an existing cluster for testing. Steps and customization options for the `install` command are described in this link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/blob/main/docs/howto/install_package.md[How To guide] in the `elastic-package` repository.
====
+
. After the cluster has finished setting up, open a second terminal window and run the following command to install your package:
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package install
----

. After the command runs, check that your new package appears in Kibana under **Management > Integrations > Installed integrations**.

[[qs-create-dataset]]
== Step 3: Create a dataset

You've now built an integration package, but it does not contain any assets. For the goal of starting to collect logs, you need to create a dataset, and for it the Elasticsearch mappings and ingest pipelines. If you want to be able to collect data through a managed {agent}, you also need to add an agent policy template.

. Create a new dataset:
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package create data-stream
----

. When prompted, provide the following details:
+
* Data stream name: log
* Data stream title: My log lines
* Type: logs
+
The command creates the required data in the `/data_stream/log` directory. If you pick `log` as data stream name, the dataset is called `sample.log` and the final data stream created will be `logs-sample.log-default` as an example.

. To not have to worry about mappings, you can pull in all {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS) fields]. To do this, create the file `_dev/build/build.yml` under the root directory and add the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
dependencies:
  ecs:
    reference: git@v8.6.0
    import_mappings: true
----

. It's always a good idea to re-check to make sure that your package still builds and works as expected.
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package check
----

. Re-install your package.
+
[source,console]
----
elastic-package install
----
+
This reinstalls the package and create mapping templates for `logs-sample.log-*`. You can also add your own mappings under `data_stream/log/fields/fields.yml` if needed.

[discrete]
[[qs-add-processing]]
== Step 4: Add processing

You can now already ship log files to `logs-sample.log-default` but no processing will happen. So, let's create a sample log file.

. Create a file `test-sample.log` with the following contents, and save it anywhere on your local machine.
+
[source,console]
----
2024-04-21T13:44:56.657+0100 INFO Hello world
2024-04-21T13:45:56.657+0100 INFO This is a nice day
2024-04-21T13:46:56.657+0100 INFO I am working on stuff
----
+
Each line of the log file will be shipped by {agent} as a document with the message field containing the log line. You will set up the dissect processor to take the log line apart into `@timestamp`, `log.level`, and `message`.

. Next, test your ingest pipeline. In {kib} navigate to **Management > Dev Tools** and run the {ref}/simulate-pipeline-api.html[Simulate pipeline API]:
+
[source,console]
----
POST /_ingest/pipeline/_simulate
{
  "pipeline" :
  {
    "description": "logs-sample.log",
    "processors": [
      {
        "dissect" : {
          "field" : "message",
          "pattern" : "%{@timestamp} %{log.level} %{message}"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "docs": [
    {
      "_index": "index",
      "_id": "id",
      "_source": {
        "message": "2023-02-21T13:46:56.657+0100 INFO I am working on stuff"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This returns:
+
[source,console]
----
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "doc": {
        "_index": "index",
        "_version": "-3",
        "_id": "id",
        "_source": {
          "@timestamp": "2023-02-21T13:46:56.657+0100",
          "message": "I am working on stuff",
          "log": {
            "level": "INFO"
          }
        },
        "_ingest": {
          "timestamp": "2024-04-30T17:51:22.16442471Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

. Now that you've confirmed that the ingest pipeline is working, add it to your dataset by modifying `data_stream/log/elasticsearch/ingest_pipline/default.yml` to:
+
[source,console]
----
description: Pipeline for processing sample logs
processors:
- dissect:
    field: message
    pattern: "%{@timestamp} %{log.level} %{message}"
on_failure:
- set:
    field: error.message
    value: '{{ _ingest.on_failure_message }}'
----

. Now run `elastic-package check` again and then re-upload the package with `elastic-package install`. This installs your new ingest pipeline.

. Do a quick test run to test the new pipeline. In the **Dev tools** console, run:
+
[source,console]
----
POST logs-sample.log-default/_doc
{
  "message": "2023-02-21T13:46:56.657+0100 INFO I am working on stuff"
}
----
+
The response is:
+
[source,console]
----
{
  "_index": ".ds-logs-sample.log-default-2024.04.30-000001",
  "_id": "BsUtMI8BQEniT9Md_TYh",
  "_version": 1,
  "result": "created",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
----

. Now run:
+
[source,console]
----
GET logs-sample.log-default/_search
----
+
The response is:
+
[source,console]
----
{
  "took": 1,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-sample.log-default-2024.04.30-000001",
        "_id": "BsUtMI8BQEniT9Md_TYh",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "@timestamp": "2023-02-21T13:46:56.657+0100",
          "message": "I am working on stuff",
          "event": {
            "agent_id_status": "missing",
            "ingested": "2024-04-30T18:04:31Z"
          },
          "log": {
            "level": "INFO"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Now that you can see the dissected message documented, you're ready to ingest data.

[discrete]
[[qs-release-new-version]]
== Step 5: Release a new version

. Since your initial `0.0.1` version of the package, many modifications have been made. To build a new package version, open the `sample/manifest.yml` file and change the package version to `0.2.0`:
+
[source,console]
----
format_version: 3.1.3
name: sample
title: "My sample package"
version: 0.2.0
----

. You also need to add an entry to your `sample/changelog.yml` file. Make sure to add the new entry at the top of the file:
+
[source,console]
----
- version: "0.2.0"
  changes:
    - description: Added sample log processing pipeline
      type: enhancement
      link: http://fake-link
----
+
NOTE: You can also update the changelog file automatically using the link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package?tab=readme-ov-file#elastic-package-changelog[`elastic-package changelog`] command.

. Run `elastic-package check` again and then the `elastic-package install` command.
+
The `0.1.0` version of the package is updated to version `0.2.0`. Only one version of a package can be installed at a time, but, following these steps, different versions of a package can be rolled out over time.

When developing integrations the following versioning guidelines should be used:

* Patch release (x.y.**Z**): For backward-compatible bug fixes
* Minor release (x.**Y**.z): For backward-compatible new features
* Major release (**X**.y.z): For changes that break backward compatibility


[discrete]
[[qs-ingest-data]]
== Step 6: Ingest data

There are two different ways that you can ingest data, using either standalone {agent} or {agent} managed by {fleet}. For this example, you can use standalone {agent} since that won't require any additional changes to the integration package.

NOTE: To run these steps using {fleet}-managed {agent}, you just need to update the files `data_stream/log/agent/stream/stream.yml.hbs` and `data_stream/log/manifest.yml` to provide the correct configuration, which you can find in the {fleet} UI.

. link:https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[Download the {agent} install package] to your machine.

. Download the {agent} package, extract it, and change into the package directory. You can find the steps for each available platform in {fleet-guide}/install-standalone-elastic-agent.html[Install standalone {agents}].
+
You can also download a package directly from the link:https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[{agent} download site].


. In the {agent} package directory, open the `elastic-agent.yml` configuration file for editing.

. Replace the contents of `elastic-agent.yml` with the following:
+
[source,console]
----
inputs:
  - type: logfile
    streams:
      - data_stream:
          # This must be aligned with the dataset name given
          dataset: test-sample.log
        paths:
          # Path to your log file
          - /<PATH-TO-LOG-FILE>/test-sample.log

outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts: ["https://127.0.0.1:9200"]
    username: "elastic"
    password: "changeme"
    ssl.verification_mode: none
----
+
Where:

* `dataset` is set to match the `test-sample.log` file that you created.
* <PATH-TO-LOG-FILE> is the full path the `test-sample.log` file that you created.

. Run {agent}:
+
[source,console]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent -e
----
+
This will pick up the log file, ship it to {es}, and process it with the ingest pipeline.

. Confirm that your log file is being ingested as expected:

.. In {kib}, open **Discover**.
.. In the search field, enter `log.file.path.text : *`. The search should return a couple of log entries.
.. Hover over an entry and click `Enter` to view the cell contents.
