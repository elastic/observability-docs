// Use this template to create tutorials within the {observability} documentation.
// Replace the text with your own. 

// To add your tutorial to the doc build, put your .asciidoc file in
// observability-docs/docs/en/observability and update tutorials.asciidoc to include
// your tutorial. Remember to update the jump list and includes.

// The title of your tutorial should focus on what the reader will achieve.
// For example, How to ingest custom data into Elasticsearch.
// The anchor id name, in this case [[tutorial-title]], must be unique and can only be used once in a doc. 
// The anchor id name should be the same as the file name.
// You can link to any ID within a document. For example, if you need to link to this section from elsewhere,
// you would use <<tutorial-title>> as the reference. 
[[tutorial-title]]
= Tutorial title

Introduce the reader to what they will do in this tutorial and provide a list
of what the reader will learn. If required, include links to topics within the {observability} docs. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

// This is an ordered list and each item is using a shared attribute for the
// product name. Shared attributes can be found here: https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/shared/attributes.asciidoc
. Install {es}
. Install {kib}
. Install {filebeat}


// This discrete marker is placed before an anchor id so that each section in this file remains on the same page when converted to HTML.

[[what-you-need]]
// The section heading. 
== What you need

Use this section to tell the reader what they will need, or any prerequisite knowledge
they require to complete the tutorial.

[[the-first-step]]
== Step 1: The first step

Break your tutorial down into discrete steps that the reader can follow. A task should be broken 
down into as many steps as are needed.

To highlight a command within a sentence, use this format: `sample command`.

To include code or command blocks, use a code block. Specify the source language, as we use the language 
as a hint for the syntax highlighter. For example:

[source,shell]
----
./elastic-agent -c elastic-agent-standalone.yml run
----

To display a sample file, specify the source format. For example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "sample_id": ENT,
    "sample_name": "String",
    "sample_number": INT,
    "line_number": "String",
    "speaker": "String",
    "text_entry": "String",
}
----

To include an image, save it in a folder in the repo, and
include it by using an `image::` statement. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::myimages/my-image.png[Alt text for the image]


[discrete]
[[the-next-step]]
== Step 2: The next step

Step 2 should follow logically from the first step. Try not to double back on content covered in Step 1.
A good approach would be to work through the task, noting the steps in order as you do.

[discrete]
[[add-more-steps]]
== Step 3: Add more steps

Add as many steps as you need to guide the reader through the process.

Now that the reader has completed your tutorial, provide a list of resources, or related features,
for further reading. This can be a bulleted list of links or a set of steps the reader should take next.
