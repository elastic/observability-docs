## {es} as the communication layer

All communication between the Fleet UI and fleet-server happens through Elasticsearch. Fleet writes policies, actions and any changes to `.fleet-*` indices in Elasticsearch. Each Fleet Server monitors these indices, picks up changes and ships it down to the Elastic Agents. The Fleet Servers write updates to the `.fleet-*` indices to communicate back to Fleet about the status of Elastic Agents and policy rollout.

//TODO:
//Provide a new diagram, highlight the deltas from 7.12 to 7.13.
//Flow of actions to different components.

//Use the [discrete] tag to keep sub-sections on this page.
