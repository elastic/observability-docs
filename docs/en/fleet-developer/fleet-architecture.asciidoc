[[fleet-communication-layer]]
== {es} as the communication layer

All communication between the {fleet} UI and {fleet-server} happens through {es}. {fleet} writes policies, actions, and any changes to the `fleet-*` indices in {es}. Each {fleet-server} monitors the indices, picks up changes, and ships it to the {agent}s. To communicate to {fleet} about the status of the {agent}s and the policy rollout, the {fleet-server}s write updates to the `fleet-*` indices.

//TODO:
//Provide a new diagram, highlight the deltas from 7.12 to 7.13.
//Flow of actions to different components.

//Use the [discrete] tag to keep sub-sections on this page.
