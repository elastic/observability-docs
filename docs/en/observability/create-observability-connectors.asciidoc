[[cases-external-connectors]]
= Configure external connectors

You can send cases to these third-party systems:

* ServiceNow ITSM
* ServiceNow SecOps
* Jira (including Jira Service Desk)
* IBM Resilient
* {swimlane}

IMPORTANT: To send cases to external systems, you need the appropriate license, and your role must
have the *Cases* {kib} privilege as a user. For more details, refer to <<grant-cases-access>>.

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system.

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.

you don’t set field mappings now, you’ll be prompted to do so if you want to use the connector for a case or a rule. This
is because the prompts no longer display once you set up the required mappings.
