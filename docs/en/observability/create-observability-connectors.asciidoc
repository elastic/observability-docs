[[cases-external-connectors]]
= Configure external connectors

You can send cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including {jira} Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}

IMPORTANT: To send cases to external systems, you need the appropriate license, and your role must
have the *Cases* {kib} privilege as a user. For more details, refer to <<grant-cases-access>>.

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system.

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.
