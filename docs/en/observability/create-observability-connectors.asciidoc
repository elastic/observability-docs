[[cases-external-connectors]]
= Configure external connectors

You can send cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including {jira} Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}

IMPORTANT: To send cases to external systems, you need the appropriate license, and your role must
have the *Cases* {kib} privilege as a user. For more details, refer to <<grant-cases-access>>.

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system.

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.

| *URL* | The URL of the external system to which you want to send cases.

| *API URL* |  ({swimlane} only) The URL of the {swimlane} instance to which you want to send cases.

| *Organization ID* | ({ibm-r} only) Your organization’s {ibm-r} ID number.

| *Application ID* | ({swimlane} only) The application ID of your {swimlane} application. From {swimlane}, you can find the application
ID by checking your application’s settings or at the end of your application’s URL after you’ve opened it.

| *Username* | ({sn} only) The username of the {sn} account is used to access the {sn} instance.

| *Password* | ({sn} only) The password of the {sn} account is used to access the {sn} instance.

| *All* | You can choose to set all or no field mappings when creating your new {swimlane} connector. However, note that if
you don’t set field mappings now, you’ll be prompted to do so if you want to use the connector for a case or a rule. This
is because the prompts no longer display once you set up the required mappings.
