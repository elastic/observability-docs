[[cases-external-connectors]]
= Configure external connectors

You can send cases to these third-party systems:

* ServiceNow ITSM
* ServiceNow SecOps
* Jira (including Jira Service Desk)
* IBM Resilient
* {swimlane}

IMPORTANT: To send cases to external systems, you need the appropriate license, and your role must
have the *Cases* {kib} privileges as a user. For more details, refer to <<grant-cases-access>>.

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system.

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.

| *Connector name* | Name for the connector. 

| *URL* | The URL of the external system to which you want to send cases.

| *API URL* | The URL of the Swimlane instance to which you want to send cases ({swimlane} only).

| *Organization ID* | Your organization’s IBM Resilient ID number (IBM Resilient only).

| *Application ID* | The application ID of your {swimlane} application. From {swimlane}, you can find the application
ID by checking your application’s settings or at the end of your application’s URL after you’ve opened it ({swimlane} only).

| *Username* | The username of the ServiceNow account is used to access the ServiceNow instance (ServiceNow only).

| *Password* | The password of the ServiceNow account is used to access the ServiceNow instance (ServiceNow only).

| *All* | You can choose to set all or no field mappings when creating your new {swimlane} connector. However, note that if
you don’t set field mappings now, you’ll be prompted to do so if you want to use the connector for a case or a rule. This
is because the prompts no longer display once you set up the required mappings. 

| *Alerts* | Provide an alert ID and rule name.

To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems:

. Go to *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
. Select the required connector from the *Incident management system* list.

To update an existing connector:

. Click *Update <connector name>*.
. Update the connector fields as required.
