[[cases-external-connectors]]
= Configure external connectors

If you are using an external incident management system, you can integrate Elastic Observability 
cases with that system using _connectors_. These third-party systems are supported:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including {jira} Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}

IMPORTANT: To send cases to external systems, you need the appropriate license, and your role must
have the *Cases* {kib} privilege as a user. For more details, refer to <<grant-cases-access>>.

You need to create a connector to send cases, which stores the information required to interact
with an external system.

After creating a connector, you can set your cases to
automatically close when they are sent to an external system.

[[Edit-connector-observability]]
== Edit a connector

You can create additional connectors, update existing connectors, and change the connector used to send cases to external systems.

TIP: You can also configure which connector is used for each case individually. See <<new-case-observability,Open a new case>>.

To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems:

. Go to *Cases* -> *Settings*.
. Select the required connector from the *Incident management system* list.

To update an existing connector:

. Click *Update <connector name>*.
. Update the connector fields as required.

[[close-connector-observability]]
== Sending and closing cases

To send a case to an external system, click the **Push as <connector name> incident** button from the individual case page. 
This information is not sent automatically. If you make further changes to the shared case fields, you should push the case again.

If you close cases in your external incident management system, the cases will remain open in Elastic Observability until you close them 
manually.

To close cases when they are sent to an external system, select
*Automatically close cases when pushing new incident to external system* when adding a connector to a case.
