== Part 3: Monitor application performance

Quickly triage and troubleshoot application performance problems with the help of Elastic
application performance monitoring (APM).

Think of a latency spike -- APM can help you narrow the scope of your investigation to a single service.
Because you've also ingested and correlated logs and metrics, you can then link the problem to CPU and memory utilization via the error log entries of a particular Kubernetes pod.

=== Step 1: Set up APM Server

Application monitoring data is streamed from your applications running in Kubernetes to APM Server,
where it is validated, processed, and transformed into {es} documents.

There are many ways to deploy APM Server when working with Kubernetes.
This guide assumes you're using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}.
If you want to manage APM Server yourself, there are a few alternative options:

* {eck-ref}/[Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)] -- The Elastic recommended approach for managing
APM Server deployed with Kubernetes.
Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, ECK extends basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities
to support the setup and management of APM Server on Kubernetes.

* Deploy APM Server as a DaemonSet -- Ensure a running instance of APM Server on each node in your cluster,
like when a single APM Server instance should be reused for any pod that may be allocated to a node.

* Deploy APM Server as a sidecar -- For environments that should not share an APM Server,
like when directing traces from multiple applications to separate {es} clusters.

* {apm-server-ref-v}/installing.html[Download and install APM Server] -- The classic, non-Kubernetes option.

=== Step 2: Set up APM Agents

In most cases, setting up APM agents and thereby instrumenting your applications
is as simple as installing a library and adding a few lines of code.
See the relevant agent setup instructions for more information:

* {apm-go-ref-v}/getting-started.html[Go agent]
* {apm-java-ref-v}/setup.html[Java agent]
* {apm-dotnet-ref-v}/setup.html[.NET agent]
* {apm-node-ref-v}/set-up.html[Node.js agent]
* {apm-py-ref-v}/set-up.html[Python agent]
* {apm-ruby-ref-v}/set-up.html[Ruby agent]

=== Step 3: (Optional) Attach the agent

Some agents offer the ability to instrument supported technologies without
any changes to an application image or code.
To do this, you'll need an https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[init container]
based on an official Elastic APM docker image.

Before your application starts, copy the agent from the init container into a shared volume.
For example, with the Java agent:

[source,yml]
----
    # ...
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: elastic-apm-agent <1>
        emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:
      - name: elastic-java-agent
        image: docker.elastic.co/observability/apm-agent-java:1.12.0 <2>
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /elastic/apm/agent
          name: elastic-apm-agent
        command: ['cp', '-v', '/usr/agent/elastic-apm-agent.jar', '/elastic/apm/agent'] <3>
----
<1> The shared volume
<2> Build the initContainer from the official Elastic Java agent image
<3> Copy the agent to the shared volume

The Java command line needs a way to pick up this `javaagent` configuration.
You can use the standard JVMTI https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#tooloptions[JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS] environment variable to do this.
It doesn't have to be explicitly specified and is picked up automatically by the JVM when it starts.

TIP: For JVMs that don't support this option, you can use any other environment variable --
either one already defined in your startup script, like `JAVA_OPTS` in some servlet container scripts,
or add a dedicated empty one that will have no effect if it's not set.

[source,yml]
----
      # ...
      containers:
      - name: your-app-container
        env:
        # ...
        - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS <1>
          value: -javaagent:/elastic/apm/agent/elastic-apm-agent.jar
----
<1> Used for the command line to pick up the `javaagent` configuration

[discrete]
=== Step 4: Save the secret token

A {apm-server-ref-v}/secret-token.html[secret token] is used to secure communication between APM agents
and APM Server. In your {ecloud} deployment page, select *APM* and copy your APM Server secret token.
If you're managing APM Server yourself, see {apm-server-ref-v}/secret-token.html[secret token] for instructions
on how to set up your secret token.

To avoid exposing the secret token, you can store it in a Kubernetes secret. For example:

[source, cmd]
----
kubectl create secret generic apm-secret --from-literal=ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN=asecretpassword --namespace=kube-system <1>
----
<1> Create the secret in the same namespace that you'll be deploying your applications in.

[discrete]
=== Step 5: General agent configuration

Agent configuration values can be passed in as environment variables for your application's container.
Here's a sample configuration:

[source,yml]
----
      # ...
      containers:
      - name: your-app-container
        env:
        # ...
        - name: ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL
          value: "apm-server-url-goes-here"
        - name: ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: apm-secret
              key: ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN <1>
        - name: ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME
          value: "petclinic"
        - name: ELASTIC_APM_APPLICATION_PACKAGES
          value: "org.springframework.samples.petclinic"
        - name: ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT
          value: test
        - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS <2>
          value: -javaagent:/elastic/apm/agent/elastic-apm-agent.jar
----
<1> Pass in `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` from the `apm-secret` keystore created previously
<2> Necessary only when attaching the agent

[discrete]
=== Step 6: Kubernetes data configuration

In most instances, APM agents automatically read Kubernetes data from inside the
container and send it to APM Server.
If this is not the case, or if you wish to override this data,
you can set environment variables for the agents to read.
These environment variable are set via the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api[Downward API].

For example, here’s how you would add the environment variables to your kubernetes pod spec:

[source,yml]
----
      # ...
      containers:
      - name: your-app-container
        env:
        # ...
        - name: KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: spec.nodeName
        - name: KUBERNETES_POD_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.name
        - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        - name: KUBERNETES_POD_UID
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.uid
----

The table below maps these environment variables to the APM metadata event field:

[options="header"]
|=====
|Environment variable |Metadata field name
|KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME |system.kubernetes.node.name
|KUBERNETES_POD_NAME |system.kubernetes.pod.name
|KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE |system.kubernetes.namespace
|KUBERNETES_POD_UID	|system.kubernetes.pod.uid
|=====

=== Step 7: Deploy your application

APM agents are deployed with your application:

[source,cmd]
----
kubectl apply -f path-to-your-app.yml
----

[discrete]
=== View your traces in Kibana

To view your application's trace data, open Kibana and go to *Observability* *>* *APM*.

The APM app allows you to monitor your software services and applications in real-time:
visualize detailed performance information on your services, identify and analyze errors,
and monitor host-level and agent-specific metrics like JVM and Go runtime metrics.

Having access to application-level insights with just a few clicks can drastically decrease the time you spend debugging errors, slow response times, and crashes.

Best of all, because Kubernetes environment variables have been mapped to APM metadata events,
you can filter your trace data by Kubernetes `namespace`, `node.name`, `pod.name`, and `pod.uid`.
