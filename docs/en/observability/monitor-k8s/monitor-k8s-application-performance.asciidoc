== Part 4: Monitor application performance

Quickly triage and troubleshoot application performance problems with the help of Elastic
application performance monitoring (APM).

Think of a latency spike -- APM can help you narrow the scope of your investigation to a single service.
Because you've also ingested and correlated logs and metrics, you can then link the problem to CPU and memory utilization or error log entries of a particular Kubernetes pod.

=== Step 1: Set up APM

Application monitoring data is streamed from your applications running in Kubernetes to APM,
where it is validated, processed, and transformed into {es} documents.

There are many ways to deploy APM when working with Kubernetes,
but this guide assumes that you're using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}.
If you haven't done so already, enable APM in the {ess-console}[{ess} console].

If you want to manage APM yourself, there are a few alternative options:

[%collapsible]
.Expand alternatives
====
* {eck-ref}/[{ecloud} on Kubernetes (ECK)] -- The Elastic recommended approach for managing
APM Server deployed with Kubernetes.
Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, ECK extends basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities
to support the setup and management of APM Server on Kubernetes.

* Deploy APM Server as a DaemonSet -- Ensure a running instance of APM Server on each node in your cluster.
Useful when all pods in a node should share a single APM Server instance.

* Deploy APM Server as a sidecar -- For environments that should not share an APM Server,
like when directing traces from multiple applications to separate {es} clusters.

* {observability-guide}/apm-getting-started-apm-server.html[Download and install APM Server] -- The classic, non-Kubernetes option.

=== Step 2: Save your secret token

A {observability-guide}/apm-secret-token.html[secret token] is used to secure communication between APM agents
and APM Server. To create or update your secret token in {kib}:

. Open Kibana and navigate to Fleet.
. Under the *Agent policies* tab, select the policy you would like to configure.
. Find the Elastic APM integration and select *Actions → Edit integration*.
. Navigate to *Agent authorization → Secret token* and set the value of your token.
. Click Save integration. The APM Server will restart before the change takes effect.

To avoid exposing the secret token, you can store it in a Kubernetes secret. For example:

[source, cmd]
----
kubectl create secret generic apm-secret --from-literal=ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN=asecretpassword --namespace=kube-system <1>
----
<1> Create the secret in the same namespace that you'll be deploying your applications in.

If you're managing APM Server yourself,
see {observability-guide}/apm-secret-token.html[secret token] for instructions on how to set up your secret token.

If you are using ECK to set up APM Server, the operator automatically generates an `{APM-server-name}-apm-token` secret for you.

=== Step 3: Install and configure APM Agents

In most cases, setting up APM agents and thereby instrumenting your applications
is as easy as installing a library and adding a few lines of code.

Select your application's language for details:

include::{observability-docs-root}/docs/en/shared/install-apm-agents-kube/widget.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
=== Step 4: Configure Kubernetes data

In most instances, APM agents automatically read Kubernetes data from inside the
container and send it to APM Server.
If this is not the case, or if you wish to override this data,
you can set environment variables for the agents to read.
These environment variable are set via the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api[Downward API]
in your Kubernetes pod spec:

[source,yml]
----
      # ...
      containers:
      - name: your-app-container
        env:
        # ...
        - name: KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: spec.nodeName
        - name: KUBERNETES_POD_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.name
        - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        - name: KUBERNETES_POD_UID
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.uid
----

The table below maps these environment variables to the APM metadata event field:

[options="header"]
|=====
| Environment variable |Metadata field name
| `KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME` |system.kubernetes.node.name
| `KUBERNETES_POD_NAME` |system.kubernetes.pod.name
| `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` |system.kubernetes.namespace
| `KUBERNETES_POD_UID`	|system.kubernetes.pod.uid
|=====

=== Step 5: Deploy your application

APM agents are deployed with your application.

=== View your traces in {kib}

To view your application's trace data, open {kib} and go to *{observability} → Services*.

The {apm-app} allows you to monitor your software services and applications in real-time:
visualize detailed performance information on your services, identify and analyze errors,
and monitor host-level and agent-specific metrics like JVM and Go runtime metrics.

Having access to application-level insights with just a few clicks can drastically decrease the time you spend debugging errors, slow response times, and crashes.

Best of all, because Kubernetes environment variables have been mapped to APM metadata events,
you can filter your trace data by Kubernetes `namespace`, `node.name`, `pod.name`, and `pod.uid`.
