Applications running in a containerized environment like Kubernetes pose a
unique monitoring challenge: how do you diagnose and resolve issues with
hundreds of microservices on thousands (or millions) of containers, running
in ephemeral and disposable pods?

A successful Kubernetes monitoring solution has a few requirements:

* Monitors all layers of your technology stack, including:
** The host systems where Kubernetes is running.
** Kubernetes core components, nodes, pods, and containers running within
the cluster.
** All the applications and services running in Kubernetes containers.

* Automatically detects and monitors services as they appear dynamically.

* Provides a way to correlate related data so that you can group and explore
related metrics, logs, and other observability data.

== What you’ll learn

This guide describes how to use Elastic {observability} to observe all layers of
your application, including the orchestration software itself:

* Collect logs and metrics from Kubernetes and your applications
* Collect trace data from applications deployed with Kubernetes
* Centralize the data in the {stack}
* Explore the data in real-time using tailored dashboards and {observability} UIs

//TODO: Add APM goals here

This guide describes how to deploy Elastic monitoring agents as DaemonSets using
`kubectl` and the manifest files from the Beats GitHub repository. For other
deployment options, see the Kubernetes operator and custom resource definitions
from {eck-ref}/index.html[{ecloud} on Kubernetes (ECK)] or the
https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/README.md[Helm charts].
