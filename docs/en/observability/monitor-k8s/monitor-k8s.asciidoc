Applications running in a containerized environment like Kubernetes pose a
unique monitoring challenge: how do you diagnose and resolve issues with
hundreds of microservices on thousands (or millions) of containers, running
in ephemeral and disposable pods?

This guide describes how to use Elastic Observability to observe all layers of
your application, including the orchestration software itself.

//TODO: Remove the following list along with all author names before publishing. 

//*Assumptions made during content development:*

//* Users are familiar with Kubernetes concepts.
//* We will publish this content in phases. The first phase will include the
//monitoring overview plus sections about monitoring K8s logs and metrics.
//* We may provide a sample application to complement this guide.
//* We will update this guide to use Elastic Agent + integrations when Fleet is
//GA.

== What you’ll learn

[Author: DeDe]

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

* Collect logs and metrics from Kubernetes
* Centralize the data in the {stack}
* Explore the data in real-time using tailored dashboards and Observability UIs

//TODO: Add APM goals here

This guide describes how to deploy Elastic monitoring agents as DaemonSets.
For other deployment options, see {eck-ref}/index.html[{ecloud} on Kubernetes (ECK)]
and https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/README.md[Helm charts].

== Before you begin

To monitor Kubernetes, you need {es} for storing and searching your
observability data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing it. For more
information, see <<install-observability>>.

//TODO: will need to replace the above link with <<spin-up-stack>> when we
//master is merged into this branch.
