IMPORTANT: To create and manage SLOs, you need an {subscriptions}[appropriate license].

You can enable access to SLOs in two different ways:

* Creating the following roles, depending on the type of access needed:
** <<slo-all-access,*SLO Editor*>> — Create, edit, and manage SLOs and their historical summaries.
** <<slo-read-access,*SLO Viewer*>> — See SLOs and their historical summaries.

* Using the `editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role]. This role grants full access to all features in {kib} (including the {observability} solution)
and read-only access to data indices. Users assigned to this role can create, edit, and manage SLOs.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role] grants write access
to _all_ {kib} apps. If you want to limit access to the SLOs only, you have
to manually create and assign the mentioned roles.
====

To create a role:

. From the left navigation in {kib}, under *Management* select *Stack Management*.
. Under *Security*, select *Roles*.
. Click *Create role* in the upper-right corner of the page.
