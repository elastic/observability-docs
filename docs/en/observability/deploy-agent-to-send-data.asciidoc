= Deploy {agent} to send data

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query
data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and
more. 

Prefer to use our legacy {beats} for your use case? Refer to
