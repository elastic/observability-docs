= Deploy {agent} to send data

{agent} is a single agent for logs, metrics, uptime, security data, and threat
prevention. You deploy the agent to your hosts or containers, and behind the
scenes, {agent} it runs the {beats} shippers or {elastic-endpoint} required for
your configuration. The shippers are managed by {agent} -- you do not install or
configure them individually.

Prefer to use our legacy {beats} for your use case? Refer to
<<deploy-beats-to-send-data>>.
