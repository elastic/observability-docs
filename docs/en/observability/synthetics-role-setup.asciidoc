[[synthetics-role-setup]]
= Setup role

Administrators who set up Synthetics typically need to enable Monitor Management.

Enabling Monitor Management is an admin-level task that requires extra privileges and
must be completed just once by an admin before any users with the <<synthetics-role-write>>
can create synthetic monitors. This applies to monitors created via both
<<synthetics-get-started-project,projects>> and <<synthetics-get-started-ui,the UI>>.

As a best practice, *grant the setup role to administrators only*, and use a more restrictive
role for event publishing.

This role grants full access to all features in {kib} (including the {observability} solution)
and read-only access to data indices.
. Grant the role the following additional privileges, which are required to enable Monitor Management:
