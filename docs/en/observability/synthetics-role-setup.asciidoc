[[synthetics-role-setup]]
= Setup role

Administrators who set up Synthetics typically need to enable Monitor Management.

Enabling Monitor Management is an admin-level task that requires extra privileges and
must be completed just once by an admin before any users with the <<synthetics-role-write>>
can create synthetic monitors. This applies to monitors created via both
<<synthetics-get-started-project,projects>> and <<synthetics-get-started-ui,the UI>>.

As a best practice, *grant the setup role to administrators only*, and use a more restrictive
role for event publishing.

Create a *setup role*, called something like `synthetics_setup`:

. Start with the `editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role].
This role grants full access to all features in {kib} (including the {observability} solution)
and read-only access to data indices.

[NOTE]
====
The `editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role] will grant write access
to _all_ {kib} apps. If you want to limit write access to the {synthetics-app} only,
refer to <<synthetics-write-privileges-limited>>.

If you choose this approach, you will still need to grant the privileges in the next step.

. Grant the role additional privileges that are required to enable Monitor Management:
