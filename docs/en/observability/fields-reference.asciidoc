[[fields-reference]]
= Fields reference

This section lists Elastic Common Schema (ECS) fields the Logs and Infrastructure apps use to display data.

ECS is an open source specification that defines a standard set of fields to use when storing event data in
{es}, such as logs and metrics. 

Beat modules (for example, {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[{filebeat} modules])
are ECS-compliant, so manual field mapping is not required, and all data is
populated automatically in the Logs and Infrastructure apps. If you cannot use {beats}, map your data to
{ecs-ref}[ECS fields] (see {ecs-ref}/ecs-converting.html[how to map data to ECS]).
You can also try using the experimental https://github.com/elastic/ecs-mapper[ECS Mapper] tool.
