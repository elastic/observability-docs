= What is Elastic Observability? 

Observability provides you with granular insights and context into the behaviour
of applications running in your environments. At Elastic, we view observability as an
attribute of any system that you build and want to monitor. Being able to detect
and fix root cause events quickly within an observable system is what we consider
a minimum requirement for any analyst.

Do you face the difficulty of ingesting metrics into one system and logs into 
another system? Are you also using a separate APM tool? Are you finding that manual
correlation of these various data sources is time consuming and maintenance is a 
significant operational cost?

With https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic Observability], we provide you with a 
single stack to unify your logs, system metrics, uptime data, and application traces. 
Each one of your ingested data
sources creates an index in https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch[{es}], with no restrictions on:

- aggregations that you run across all of your data
- how data is displayed in https://www.elastic.co/kibana[{kib}]
- how alerting and machine learning applies to each data source

You can search, monitor, and apply analytics in real time to events happening across all of
your environments.
