= What is Elastic Observability? 

Observability provides you with granular insights and context into the behaviour
of applications running in your environments. At Elastic, we view observability as an
attribute of any system that you build and want to monitor. Being able to detect
and fix root cause events quickly within an observable system is what we consider
a minimum requirement for any analyst.

https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic Observability] provides you with a 
single stack to unify your logs, system metrics, uptime data, and application traces. 
Ingest your data directly to {es}, where you can further process and enhance the data,
before visualizing it in {kib}.

Search, monitor, and apply analytics in real time to events happening across all of
your environments. Analyze the logs for a specific transaction, monitor the performance metrics
for the host or container that it ran in, trace the transaction, and check the overall
service availability.

[[logs-overview]]
== Logs data

Analyze log data from your hosts, services, Kubernetes, Apache, and many more. To view a
live stream of your logs and to filter, pin, or highlight the data you need, drill-down into the {logs-app}.

[[metrics-overview]]
== Metrics data

Monitor system and service metrics from your servers, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, along with other
services and applications. To monitor and filter your data by hosts, pods, containers,
or EC2 instances, drill-down into the {metrics-app}. You can also create custom groupings such as
availability zones or namespaces.

[[apm-overview]]
== APM data

To instrument your code and collect performance data and errors at runtime, install APM agents
like Java, Go, .NET, and many more. To quickly find the APM traces for underlying services,
drill-down into the APM app.

[[uptime-overview]]
== Uptime data

Install and configure Heartbeat on your servers to monitor host availability, service
uptime, web site endpoints, and API monitoring. For detailed
monitor summaries, with support for monitors from multiple locations, drill-down into
the {uptime-app}.
