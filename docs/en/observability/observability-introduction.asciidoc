= What is Elastic Observability?

Observability provides you with granular insights and context into the behavior
of applications running in your environments. At Elastic, we view observability as an
attribute of any system that you build and want to monitor. Being able to detect
and fix root cause events quickly within an observable system is what we consider
a minimum requirement for any analyst.

https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic Observability] provides you with a
single stack to unify your logs, metrics, uptime data, application traces, user experience data, and synthetics.
Ingest your data directly to {es}, where you can further process and enhance the data,
before visualizing it in {kib}.

Search, monitor, and apply analytics in real time to events happening across all of
your environments. Analyze the logs for a specific transaction, monitor the performance metrics
for the host or container that it ran in, trace the transaction, and check the overall
service availability.

[[logs-overview]]
== Logs data

Analyze log data from your hosts, services, Kubernetes, Apache, and many more. To view a
live stream of your logs and to filter, pin, or highlight the data you need, drill-down into the {logs-app}.

[float]
[[metrics-overview]]
== Metrics data

Monitor system and service metrics from your servers, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, along with other
services and applications. To monitor and filter your data by hosts, pods, containers,
or EC2 instances, drill-down into the {metrics-app}. You can also create custom groupings such as
availability zones or namespaces.

[float]
[[apm-overview]]
== APM data

To instrument your code and collect performance data and errors at runtime, install APM agents
like Java, Go, .NET, and many more. To quickly find the APM traces for underlying services,
drill-down into the APM app.

[float]
[[uptime-overview]]
== Uptime data

Install and configure Heartbeat on your servers to monitor host availability, service
uptime, web site endpoints, and API monitoring. For detailed
monitor summaries, with support for monitors from multiple locations, drill-down into
the {uptime-app}.

[float]
[[user-experience-overview]]
== User experience data

User Experience data, powered by the APM Real User Monitoring (RUM) agent,
provides a way to quantify and analyze the perceived performance of your web application.

[float]
[[synthetic-monitoring-overview]]
== Synthetic monitoring data (experimental)

Synthetic monitoring allows you to simulate actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment.
The end result is rich, consistent, and repeatable data that you can trend and alert on.

[float]
[[alerts-overview]]
== Alerting

To help keep you aware of potential issues in your environments, the {logs-app}, {metrics-app},
APM app, and the {uptime-app} all integrate with {kib}â€™s alerting
and actions feature. It provides a set of built-in actions and specific threshold alerts
for you to use and enables central management of all alerts from {kib} Management.
