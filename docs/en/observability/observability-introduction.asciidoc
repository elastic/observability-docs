= What is Elastic Observability? 

Observability provides you with granular insights and context into the behaviour
of systems running in your environments. At Elastic, we view observability as an
attribute of any system that you build and want to monitor. Being able to detect
and fix root cause events quickly within an observable system is what we consider
a minimum requirement for any analyst.

Do you face the difficulty of ingesting metrics into one system and logs into 
another system? Are you also using a separate APM tool? Are you finding that manual
correlation of these various data sources is time consuming and maintenance is a 
significant operational cost?

With Elastic Observability, we provide you with a single stack to unify your logs,
system metrics, uptime data, and application traces. Each one of your ingested data
sources creates an index in {ess} with no restrictions on aggregations that you run
across all of this data, on how its displayed in {kib}, and on how alerting and
machine learning applies to each source. This unified approach enables you to search,
monitor, and apply analytics in real time to events happening across all of your 
environments.
