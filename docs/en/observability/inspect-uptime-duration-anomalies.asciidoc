= Inspect uptime duration anomalies

When the {anomaly-detect} features of {ml} are enabled,
each monitor location is modelled. When a monitor runs
for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and highlighted
on the *Monitor duration* chart.

== Enable uptime duration anomaly detection

Create a machine learning job to detect anomalous monitor duration rates automatically.

1. On the *Overview* page, select on a monitor to view it's the details.
2. In the *Monitor duration* panel, click *Enable anomaly detection*.
+
You are prompted to create a <<duration-anomaly-alert,response duration anomaly alert>> for the machine learning job which will carry
out the analysis, and you can configure which severity level to create the alert for.
+
3. You're now ready to explore your log partitions.

When an anomaly is detected, the duration is displayed on the *Monitor duration*
chart, along with the duration times. The colors represent the criticality of the anomaly: red
(critical) and yellow (minor).

You can also view log anomalies directly in the {kibana-ref}/xpack-ml-anomalies.html[Machine Learning app].
