= Inspect uptime duration anomalies

Each monitor location is modeled, and when a monitor runs
for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and highlighted
on the *Monitor duration* chart.

== Enable uptime duration {anomaly-detect}

Create a {ml} job to detect anomalous monitor duration rates automatically.

// lint disable observability anomaly-detection
1. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime > Monitors*, and then click a monitor to view its the details.
2. In the *Monitor duration* panel, click *Enable anomaly detection*.

[NOTE]
=====
If {anomaly-detect} is already enabled, click *Anomaly detection* and select to view duration anomalies directly in the
{ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[{ml-app} app], enable an <<duration-anomaly-alert,anomaly rule>>,
or disable the {anomaly-detect}.
=====
+
3. You are prompted to create a <<duration-anomaly-alert,response duration anomaly rule>> for the {ml} job which will carry
out the analysis, and you can configure which severity level to create the rule for.
// lint enable observability anomaly-detection

When an anomaly is detected, the duration is displayed on the *Monitor duration*
chart, along with the duration times. The colors represent the criticality of the anomaly: red
(critical) and yellow (minor).
