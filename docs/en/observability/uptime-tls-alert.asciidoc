[[tls-certificate-alert]]
= Create a TLS certificate alert

Within the {uptime-app}, you can create an alert that notifies
you when one or more of your monitors has a TLS certificate expiring
within a specified threshold, or when it exceeds an age limit.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.
. On the *Overview* page, click *Alerts > Create alert*.
. Select *TLS alert*.

[[tls-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

The threshold values for each condition are configurable on the
<<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.

You can specify the following thresholds for your alert.

|=== 

| *Expiration threshold* | The `expiration` threshold specifies when you are notified
about certificates that are approaching expiration dates.

| *Age limit* | The `age` threshold specifies when you are notified about certificates
that have been valid for too long.

|=== 

Let’s set up an alert to notify us when any of the TLS certificates on sites we’re monitoring
are close to expiring. Let’s check every 6 hours and send a notification every 12 hours.

[[action-types-certs]]
== Action types

You can extend your alerts by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are {kib} services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {kib} server when alert conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.
