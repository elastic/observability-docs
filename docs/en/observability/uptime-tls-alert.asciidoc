Within the {uptime-app}, you can create a rule that notifies
you when one or more of your monitors has a TLS certificate expiring
within a specified threshold, or when it exceeds an age limit.

. To access this page, go to **{observability}** -> **Uptime**.
. At the top of the page, click **Alerts and rules** -> **Create rule**.
. Select **TLS rule**.

[[tls-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

The threshold values for each condition are configurable on the
<<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.

You can specify the following thresholds for your rule.

|===

| *Expiration threshold* | The `expiration` threshold specifies when you are notified
about certificates that are approaching expiration dates.

| *Age limit* | The `age` threshold specifies when you are notified about certificates
that have been valid for too long.

|===

Let's create a rule to check every 6 hours and notify us when any of the TLS certificates on sites we're monitoring are close to expiring.

[[action-types-certs]]
== Action types

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are {kib} services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.

include::../shared/alerting-connectors.asciidoc[]

After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a summary of alerts on each check interval or on a custom interval. Alternatively, you can set the action frequency such that you choose how often the action runs (for example, at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a custom action interval). In this case, you must also select the specific threshold condition that affects when actions run: `Uptime TLS Alert` or `Recovered`. For example, send a notification when an alert status changes:

In this example, actions are not repeated when an alert remains active across checks. Actions run only when the alert status changes.

== Action variables

Use the default notification message or customize it.
You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box
and selecting from a list of available variables.

[[recovery-variables-certs]]
== Alert recovery

To receive a notification when the alert recovers, select *Run when Recovered*. Use the default notification message or customize it. You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.
