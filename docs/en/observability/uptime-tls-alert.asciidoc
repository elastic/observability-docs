[[tls-certificate-alert]]
= Create a TLS certificate rule

Within the {uptime-app}, you can create a rule that notifies
you when one or more of your monitors has a TLS certificate expiring
within a specified threshold, or when it exceeds an age limit.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.
. At the top of the page, click *Alerts and rules > Create rule*.
. Select *TLS rule*.

[[tls-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

The threshold values for each condition are configurable on the
<<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.

You can specify the following thresholds for your rule.

|=== 

| *Expiration threshold* | The `expiration` threshold specifies when you are notified
about certificates that are approaching expiration dates.

| *Age limit* | The `age` threshold specifies when you are notified about certificates
that have been valid for too long.

|=== 

Let’s create a rule to notify us when any of the TLS certificates on sites we’re monitoring
are close to expiring. Let’s check every 6 hours and send a notification when an alert status changes.
This means actions are not repeated when an alert remains active across checks. Actions will run only when the
alert status changes.

[[action-types-certs]]
== Action types

You can extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are {kib} services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.
