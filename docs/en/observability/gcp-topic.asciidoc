There are three available filesets:
`audit`, `vpcflow`, `firewall`. This tutorial covers the `audit` fileset.

. Go to the *Logs Router* page to configure GCP to export logs to a Pub/Sub
topic. Use the search bar to find the page:

+
To set up the logs routing sink, click  *Create sink*.
Set *sink name* as `monitor-gcp-audit-sink`. Select the *Cloud Pub/Sub topic* as the
*sink service* and *Create new Cloud Pub/Sub topic* named `monitor-gcp-audit`:

Finally, under *Choose logs to include in sink*, add
`logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com"` (it includes all audit logs).
Click *create sink*.  It will look something like the following:

. Now go to the *Pub/Sub* page to add a subscription to the topic you just
created. Use the search bar to find the page:

To add a subscription to the `monitor-gcp-audit` topic click
*Create subscription*:

Set `monitor-gcp-audit-sub` as the *Subscription ID* and leave the
*Delivery type* as pull:
