You may only be interested in a specific set of data so you can identify underlying
signals quickly. Or perhaps you want to manipulate your data to perform vital investigations
without the need for deep domain knowledge.

Using the Exploratory view, you can filter your data and build visualizations that help you
clarify what's essential and examine the cause or impact of performance
difficulties.
