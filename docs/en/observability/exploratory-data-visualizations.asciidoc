= Exploratory view

The *Exploratory view* in {kib} enables you to select and filter result data in any dimension and look for the cause or impact of performance problems. You can build and analyze custom aggregation-based visualizations of your
Synthetics, Real User Monitoring (RUM) and Mobile APM data to help you examine data in detail, discover insights and add to existing cases.

Based on your synthetic monitoring, user experience, and mobile
 experience data, you can create multi-series visualizations of performance and device
 distributions, key performance indicators (KPI) over time, and core web vitals
 of your web applications.

You can use Exploratory view to filter your data and build multi-series
visualizations that help you clarify what's essential and examine the cause or
impact of performance difficulties. You can compare different time periods,
different cohorts and even different data types. You can add visualizations to
 an existing case to support any diagnosis or recommended actions.

To customize a visualization further, click *Open in Lens* where you can
modify visualizations with the drag and drop editor. To learn more, see {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens].

== What report types are available?

[options,header]
|===
|Report type | Description

|KPI over time
|The KPI over time histogram represents the performance indicators based on the
metric you select.

If accessing from the User experience app, the `page views` metric is selected by default. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs with specific metric data.

If accessing from the Uptime app, the `monitor duration` metric is selected by default. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs with specific metric data. The visualization helps you gain insights into how quickly requests resolve by the targeted endpoint and give you a sense of how frequently a host or endpoint was down in your selected timespan.

The monitor duration chart displays the timing for each check that Heartbeat performed across all your monitors.

|Performance distribution
|The Performance distribution time-series chart enables you to examine the perceived performance of your web applications based on the metric you select.

|Core web vitals
|The Core web vitals chart is a graphical representation of key metrics, such as loading performance, load responsiveness, and visual stability, for each of your web applications.

To learn more about metrics such as Largest contentful paint, First input delay, and Cumulative layout shift, see {observability-guide}/user-experience.html#user-experience-metrics[{user-experience} metrics].

|Device distribution
|The Device distribution chart displays device information such as OS, carrier name, connection type etc.

You can create multi-series visualizations for each report type but you cannot combine different report types in one visualization - click *Remove series* and then *Add series* if you want to change report type for your visualization.

== Create multi-series visualizations

The Explore Data view is currently enabled for the following apps:

* Metrics
* Uptime
* User Experience

To create a multi-series visualization:

. Click *Explore data* from a compatible app.
* The report type will default to the most appropriate for the app but you can edit the series or add more series to the visualization. For example, if you click *Explore Data* from the Uptime app, the `Synthetics monitoring` data type and `Monitor duration` report metric will be pre-selected.
. Click *Add series* to define an additional series for the visualization.
. Click *Select data type* and choose from the following options:
* Synthetics monitoring
* User experience (RUM)
* Mobile experience
. Click *Select report metric* and select the options and filters you need. You will see a *Missing...* warning if required fields (highlighted with red underline) are incomplete.
. Click *Apply changes* to see the updated visualization or repeat the *Add series* process to expand the visualization.
. To add the visualization to an existing case, click *Add to case* and select the correct case.
