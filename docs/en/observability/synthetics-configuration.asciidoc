Synthetic tests support the configuration of dynamic parameters that can be
used in projects. In addition, the Synthetics agent, which is built on top
of Playwright, supports configuring browser and context options that are available
in Playwright-specific methods, for example, `ignoreHTTPSErrors`, `extraHTTPHeaders`, and `viewport`.

[[synthetics-config-file]]

Create a `synthetics.config.js` or `synthetics.config.ts` file in the root of the
synthetics project and specify the options. For example:

[source,ts]
----
import type { SyntheticsConfig } from '@elastic/synthetics';

export default env => {
  const config: SyntheticsConfig = {
    params: {
      url: 'https://www.elastic.co',
    },
    playwrightOptions: {
      ignoreHTTPSErrors: false,
    },
    /**
     * Configure global monitor settings
     */
    monitor: {
      schedule: 10,
      locations: [ 'us_east' ],
    },
    /**
     * Project monitors settings
     */
    project: {
      id: 'my-project',
      url: 'https://abc123',
      space: 'custom-space',
    },
  };
  if (env !== 'development') {
    /**
     * Override configuration specific to environment
     * For example, config.params.url = ""
     */
  }
  return config;
};
----

[NOTE]
=====
`env` in the example above is the environment you are pushing from
_not_ the environment where monitors will run. In other words, `env`
corresponds to the configured `NODE_ENV`.
=====

The configuration file can either export an object, or a function that when
called should return the generated configuration. To know more about configuring
the tests based on environments, look at the <<synthetics-dynamic-configs, dynamic configuration>> documentation.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-configuration-params]]
= `params`

A JSON object that defines any variables your tests require.
Read more in <<synthetics-params-secrets>>.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-configuration-playwright-options]]
= `playwrightOptions`

For all available options, refer to the https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration[Playwright documentation].

Below are details on a few Playwright options that are particularly relevant to Elastic Synthetics including timeouts, timezones, and device emulation.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-configuration-playwright-options-timeouts]]
== Timeouts

Playwright has two types of timeouts that are used in Elastic Synthetics:
https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts#action-and-navigation-timeouts[action and navigation timeouts].

Elastic Synthetics uses a default action and navigation timeout of 50 seconds.
You can override this default using https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-action-timeout[`actionTimeout`] and https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-navigation-timeout[`navigationTimeout`]
in `playwrightOptions`.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-configuration-playwright-options-timezones]]
== Timezones and locales

The Elastic global managed testing infrastructure does not currently set the timezone.
For {private-location}s, the monitors will use the timezone of the host machine running
the {agent}. This is not always desirable if you want to test how a web application
behaves across different timezones. To specify what timezone to use when the monitor runs,
you can use `playwrightOptions` on a per monitor or global basis.

To use a timezone and/or locale for all monitors in the project, set
https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation#locale%2D%2Dtimezone[`locale` and/or `timezoneId`]
in the configuration file:

[source,js]
----
playwrightOptions: {
  locale: 'en-AU',
  timezoneId: 'Australia/Brisbane',
}
----

To use a timezone and/or locale for a _specific_ monitor, add these options to a
journey using <<synthetics-monitor-use,`monitor.use`>>.

// Uncomment note when this is added to the Synthetics Service

//////
[NOTE]
=====
The timezone can also be set using the {synthetics-app}.
If you specify a timezone in the configuration file or using `monitor.use` in the journey code,
that timezone with take precedence over the timezone set in the {synthetics-app}.

[[synthetics-config-device-emulation]]
== Device emulation

Users can emulate a mobile device using the configuration file.
The example configuration below runs tests in "Pixel 5" emulation mode.

[source,js]
----
import { SyntheticsConfig } from "@elastic/synthetics"
import { devices } from "playwright-chromium"

const config: SyntheticsConfig = {
  playwrightOptions: {
    ...devices['Pixel 5']
  }
}

export default config;

[discrete]
[[synthetics-configuration-project]]
= `project`

Information about the project.

id (`string`)::
A unique id associated with your project.
It will be used for logically grouping monitors.
+
If you used <<elastic-synthetics-init-command, `init` to create a project>>, this is the `<name-of-project>` you specified.

url (`string`)::
The {kib} URL for the deployment to which you want to upload the monitors.

space (`string`)::
The identifier of the target {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[{kib} space] for the pushed monitors.
Spaces help you organize pushed monitors.
Pushes to the "default" space if not specified.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-configuration-monitor]]
= `monitor`

Default values to be applied to _all_ monitors when using the <<elastic-synthetics-push-command, `@elastic/synthetics` `push` command>>.

// tag::monitor-config-options[]
`id` (`string`)::
A unique identifier for this monitor.
`name` (`string`)::
A human readable name for the monitor.
`tags` (`Array<string>`)::
A list of tags that will be sent with the monitor event. Tags are displayed in the {synthetics-app} and allow you to search monitors by tag.
`schedule` (`number`)::
The interval (in minutes) at which the monitor should run.
`enabled` (`boolean`)::
Enable or disable the monitor from running without deleting and recreating it.
`locations` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/locations/public-locations.ts#L28-L37[`Array<SyntheticsLocationsType>`])::
Where to deploy the monitor. Monitors can be deployed in multiple locations so that you can detect differences in availability and response times across those locations.
+
To list available locations you can:
+
* Run the <<elastic-synthetics-locations-command,`elastic-synthetics locations` command>>.
* Go to *Synthetics* -> *Management* and click *Create monitor*.
Locations will be listed in _Locations_.

`privateLocations` (`Array<string>`)::
The <<synthetics-private-location,{private-location}s>> to which the monitors will be deployed. These {private-location}s refer to locations hosted and managed by you, whereas
`locations` are hosted by Elastic. You can specify a {private-location} using the location's name.
+
To list available {private-location}s you can:
+
* Run the <<elastic-synthetics-locations-command,`elastic-synthetics locations` command>>
with the {kib} URL for the deployment from which to fetch available locations.
* Go to *Synthetics* -> *Management* and click *Create monitor*.
{private-location}s will be listed in _Locations_.

`throttling` (`boolean` | https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/common_types.ts#L194-L198[`ThrottlingOptions`])::
Control the monitor's download speeds, upload speeds, and latency to simulate your application's behavior on slower or laggier networks. Set to `false` to disable throttling altogether.
`screenshot` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/common_types.ts#L192[`ScreenshotOptions`])::
Control whether or not to capture screenshots. Options include `'on'`, `'off'`, or `'only-on-failure'`.

`alert` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/dsl/monitor.ts#L47-L54[`AlertConfig`])::
Enable or disable alerts. Read more about alerts in <<synthetics-settings-alerting>>.
+
`status.enabled` (`boolean`):::
Enable monitor status alerts.
+
`tls.enabled` (`boolean`):::
Enable TLS certificate alerts.

`retestOnFailure` (`boolean`)::
Enable or disable retesting when a monitor fails. Default is `true`.
+
By default, monitors are automatically retested if the monitor goes from "up" to "down".
If the result of the retest is also "down", an error will be created, and if configured, an alert sent.
Then the monitor will resume running according to the defined schedule.
Using `retestOnFailure` can reduce noise related to transient problems.
