[NOTE]
=====
If you haven't already, you need to install and configure {metricbeat} to populate
the {metrics-app} with data. For more information, see <<ingest-metrics,Ingest metrics>>.
=====

The {metrics-app} in {kib} enables you to visualize infrastructure metrics
to help diagnose problematic spikes, identify high resource utilization,
automatically discover and track pods, and unify your metrics 
with logs and APM data in {es}. 

Using {metricbeat} modules, you can ingest and analyze
metrics from servers, Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestrations, explore and
analyze Prometheus-style metrics or application telemetries, and many more.

To view the {metrics-app}, go to *Observability > Metrics*.
