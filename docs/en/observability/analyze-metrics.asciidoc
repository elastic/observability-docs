= Analyze metrics

The {metrics-app} in {kib} enables you to visualize infrastructure metrics
to help diagnose problematic spikes, identify high resource utilization,
automatically discover and track pods, and unify your metrics 
with logs and APM data in {es}. 

Using {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-modules.html[modules], you can ingest and analyze
metrics from servers, Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestrations, explore and
analyze Prometheus-style metrics or application telemetries, and many more.
