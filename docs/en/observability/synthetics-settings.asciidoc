There are several Synthetics settings you can adjust in {kib}.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-settings-alerting]]
= Alerting

Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions using *rules* across Observability apps
and send a notification using *connectors*.

When you create a new synthetic monitor, a new default synthetics rule will be applied.
To edit the default rule:

. Click *Alerts and rules* in the top bar.
. Click *Monitor status rule* to open a panel where you can edit the rule's configuration.

To view all existing rules or create new rule:

. Click *Alerts and rules* in the top bar.
. Click *Manage rules*.

Read more about creating new rules in <<create-alerts-rules>>.

In the *Alerting* tab on the Synthetics Settings page, you can add and configure connectors.
Read more about all available connectors in <<action-types-duration>>.

[[synthetics-settings-private-locations]]
= Private locations

Private locations allow you to run monitors from your own premises.
In the *Private Locations* tab, you can add and manage private locations.

After you <<synthetics-private-location-fleet-agent>> and <<synthetics-private-location-connect>>,
this is where you will add the private location so you can specify it as the location for
a monitor created using the Synthetics UI or projects.

[[synthetics-settings-global-parameters]]
= Global parameters

Global parameters can be defined once and used across the configuration of browser and lightweight monitors.

In the *Global parameters* tab, you can define variables and parameters.
This is one of several methods you can use to define variables and parameters.
To learn more about the other methods and which methods take precedence over others, see <<synthetics-params-secrets>>.

[[synthetics-settings-data-retention]]
= Data retention

When you set up a synthetic monitor, data from the monitor is saved in {ref}/data-streams.html[Elasticsearch data streams],
an append-only structure in Elasticsearch.
You can customize how long synthetics data is stored by creating your own index lifecycle policy
and attaching it to the relevant custom Component Template in Stack Management.

In the *Data retention* tab, use the links to jump to the relevant policy for each data stream.
Learn more about the data included in each data stream in <<synthetics-manage-retention>>.

[[synthetics-settings-api-keys]]
= Project API keys

Project API keys are used to push monitors remotely from a CLI or CD pipeline.

In the *Project API keys* tab, you can generate project API keys to use with your projects.
Learn more about using API keys in <<synthetics-get-started-project>>.
