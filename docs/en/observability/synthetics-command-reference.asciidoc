== `elastic-synthetics`

beta[] Heartbeat uses the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command to run and report synthetic tests.
It can also be used locally to help develop your tests.

*SYNOPSIS*

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics [options] [files] [dir]
----

*FLAGS*

You will not need to use most command line flags -- they have been implemented
purely to interact with Heartbeat.
However, there are some you may find useful.
They are documented below.

*`--debug`*::
Prints debug info.

*`--match <name>`*::
Filters journey with the name or a matching tag.

*`--tags <name...>`*::
Filters journey with the given tag(s)

*`--reporter`*::
One of `junit`, `default`, or `json`. Use the JUnit reporter to provide easily parsed output to CI
servers like Jenkins.

*`--no-headless`*::
Runs with the browser in headful mode.

*`--inline`*::
Instead of reading from a file, `cat` inline scripted journeys and pipe them through `stdin`.
For example, `cat path/to/file.js | npx @elastic/synthetics --inline`

*`--screenshots <on|off|only-on-failure>`*::
Captures screenshots for every step in the journey.

*`-h, --help`*::
Shows help for the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command.
