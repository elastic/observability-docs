[[elastic-synthetics-command]]
== `elastic-synthetics`

beta[] {heartbeat} uses the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command to run and report synthetic tests.
It can also be used locally to help develop your tests.

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics [options] [files] [dir]
----

You will not need to use most command line flags -- they have been implemented
purely to interact with {heartbeat}.
However, there are some you may find useful.
They are documented below.

*`--debug`*::
Prints debug info.

*`--match <name>`*::
Filters journey with the name or a matching tag.

*`--tags <name...>`*::
Filters journey with the given tag(s).

*`--reporter`*::
One of `junit`, `default`, or `json`. Use the JUnit reporter to provide easily parsed output to CI
servers like Jenkins.

*`--no-headless`*::
Runs with the browser in headful mode.

*`--inline`*::
Instead of reading from a file, `cat` inline scripted journeys and pipe them through `stdin`.
For example, `cat path/to/file.js | npx @elastic/synthetics --inline`.

*`--playwright-options <jsonstring>`*::
JSON object to pass in custom Playwright options for the agent. Options passed will be merged with Playwright options defined in your synthetics.config.js file. Options defined via `--playwright-options` 
take precedence.

*`--screenshots <on|off|only-on-failure>`*::
Captures screenshots for every step in the journey.

*`-h, --help`*::
Shows help for the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command.
