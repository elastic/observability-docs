[[elastic-synthetics-command]]
== `elastic-synthetics`

{heartbeat} uses the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command to run and report synthetic tests.
It can also be used locally to help develop your tests.

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics [options] [files] [dir]
----

You will not need to use most command line flags -- they have been implemented
purely to interact with {heartbeat}.
However, there are some you may find useful.
They are documented below.

*`--debug`*::
Prints debug info.

*`--match <name>`*::
Filters journey with the name or a matching tag.

*`--tags <name...>`*::
Filters journey with the given tag(s).

*`--reporter`*::
One of `junit`, `default`, or `json`. Use the JUnit reporter to provide easily parsed output to CI
servers like Jenkins.

*`--no-headless`*::
Runs with the browser in headful mode.

*`--inline`*::
Instead of reading from a file, `cat` inline scripted journeys and pipe them through `stdin`.
For example, `cat path/to/file.js | npx @elastic/synthetics --inline`.

*`--playwright-options <jsonstring>`*::
JSON object to pass in custom Playwright options for the agent.
Options passed will be merged with Playwright options defined in your synthetics.config.js file. Options defined via `--playwright-options` 
take precedence.

*`--screenshots <on|off|only-on-failure>`*::
Captures screenshots for every step in the journey.

*`-h, --help`*::
Shows help for the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command.

[[elastic-synthetics-init-command]]
== `elastic-synthetics init`

Scaffold a new project using Elastic Synthetics.

This will create a template Node.js project that includes the synthetics agent, required dependencies,
a synthetics configuration file, and example journey files.
These journeys can be edited and then pushed to {kib} to create monitors.

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics init <name-of-project>
----

[discrete]
[[elastic-synthetics-push-command]]
== `elastic-synthetics push`

Create monitors in {kib} by using your local journeys.

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics push --auth <api-key> --url <kibana-url> --project <id|name>
----

[NOTE]
====
The `push` command includes interactive prompts to prevent you from accidentally deleting or duplicating monitors.
You will see a prompt when:

* You `push` a project that used to contain one or more monitors but no longer contains any monitors.
Select `yes` to delete all monitors associated with the project ID being pushed.
* You `push` a project that's already been pushed using one project ID and then try to `push`
it using a _different_ ID. Select `yes` to create duplicates of all monitors in the project.
====

[NOTE]
====
If the journey contains external NPM packages other than the `@elastic/synthetics`,
those packages will be bundled along with the journey code when the `push` command is invoked.
However there are some limitations when using external packages:
	
* Bundled journeys after compression should not be more than 800 Kilobytes.
* Native node modules will not work as expected due to platform inconsistency. 
====

`--auth`::
API key used for {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[{kib} authentication].
+
If you are pushing to a <<private-locations,private location>>, you must use an API key generated in 8.4 or higher.
+
To create an API key, you must be logged into {kib} as a user with the following privileges:
+
* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster privileges]: _At least_ one of `manage_own_api_key`, `manage_security`, or `manage_api_key`
* {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges]: 
** _If using one or more public locations_: `All` for *Synthetics and Uptime* in the *Observability* section.
** _If using one or more private locations_: `All` for both *Fleet* and *Integrations* in the *Management* section.

`--url`::
The {kib} URL for the deployment to which you want to upload the monitors.

`--project`::
A unique id associated with your project.
It will be used for logically grouping monitors.
If you used <<elastic-synthetics-init-command, `init` to create a project>>, this is the `<name-of-project>` you specified.

`--yes`::
The `push` command includes interactive prompts to prevent you from accidentally deleting or duplicating monitors.
If running the CLI non-interactively, you can override these prompts using the `--yes` option.
When the `--yes` option is passed to `push`:
+
* If you `push` a project that used to contain one or more monitors but no longer contains any monitors,
all monitors associated with the project ID being pushed will be deleted.
* If you `push` a project that's already been pushed using one project ID and then try to `push`
it using a _different_ ID, it will create duplicates of all monitors in the project.

[[elastic-synthetics-locations-command]]
== `elastic-synthetics locations`

List all available locations for running synthetics monitors.

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics locations --url <kibana-host> --auth <api-key>
----

Run `npx @elastic/synthetics locations` with no flags to list all the available global locations managed by Elastic for running synthetics monitors.

`--url`::
The {kib} URL for the deployment from which to fetch all available public and private locations.

`--auth`::
API key used for {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[{kib} authentication].
