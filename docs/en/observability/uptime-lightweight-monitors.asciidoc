= Use lightweight monitors

// What do we want to say about lightweight monitors?

In the {uptime-app}, you can monitor the status of network endpoints using the following lightweight checks:

// lint ignore v4 v6
|===
| *HTTP monitor* | Monitor your website. The HTTP monitor checks to make sure specific endpoints return the correct
status code and display the correct text.
| *ICMP monitor* | Check the availability of your hosts. The ICMP monitor uses ICMP (v4 and v6) Echo
Requests to check the network reachability of the hosts you are pinging. This will tell you whether the
host is available and connected to the network, but doesn't tell you if a service on the host is running or
not.
| *TCP monitor* | Monitor the services running on your hosts. The TCP monitor checks individual ports
to make sure the service is accessible and running.
