You can use the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to configure a proxy used by the host-agent.
The connection to the backend ({ecloud}) will be tunneled through the proxy (no MITM-TLS) using
the CONNECT method. Basic authentication is supported. This can be useful in environments with security
policies or network restrictions that block direct connections to outside hosts. 

The following example shows how to use the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable:

```
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:port
```
