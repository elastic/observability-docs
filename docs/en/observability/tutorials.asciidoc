= Tutorials

Using Elastic {observability}, learn how to analyze log data, monitor system and
service metrics, instrument code and collect performance data, and monitor host
availability and endpoints.

The {stack} provides a variety of ways to add monitoring data to {es}.
The tutorials in this section focus on {agent} and {beats}.

It's recommended that you use {agent}, when possible, to achieve your monitoring
goals. However, if {agent} doesn't work for your use case, you can use {beats}
instead.

Not sure which agent to use? Refer to
{fleet-guide}/beats-agent-comparison.html[{beats} and {agent} capabilities].
