= Configure probabilistic profiling

beta::[]

Probabilistic profiling allows you to reduce storage costs by collecting a representative sample of profiling data. 
Over time and across the Profiling Host Agent fleet, this configuration results in approximately 50% of deployed agents collecting profiles at any given time.
This reduces storage costs with the trade-off that profile collection is not enabled at all times on all Profiling Host Agent.

== Configure probabilistic profiling

To configure probabilistic profiling,  set the `-probabilistic-threshold` and `probabilistic-interval` options.

Set the `-probabilistic-threshold` option to a unsigned integer between 1 and 99 to enable probabilistic profiling. At every probabilistic interval, a random number
between 0 and 99 is chosen. If the probabilistic threshold that you've set is greater than this random
number, the agent collects profiles from this system for the duration of the interval.

Set the `-probabilistic-interval` option to a time duration to define the time interval for
which probabilistic profiling is either enabled or disabled. The default value is 1 minute.

== Example

The following example shows how to configure the Universal Profiling agent with a threshold of 50 and an interval of 2 minutes and 30 seconds:

[source,bash]
----
sudo pf-host-agent/pf-host-agent -probabilistic-threshold=50 -probabilistic-interval=2m30s ...'
----
