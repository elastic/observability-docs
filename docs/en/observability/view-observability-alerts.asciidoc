****
Given the experimental status of this feature, you may want to disable writing to specific {observability} alert indices
or disable and remove the Alerts page altogether.
For more information on configuring alerts, see <<create-alerts-configure>>.
****

The Alerts page lists all the alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created using the Logs,
Metrics, Uptime, or APM apps.

After alerts have been triggered, you can monitor their activity to verify they are functioning correctly.
In addition, you can filter alerts and troubleshoot each alert in their respective app.

You can also add alerts to <<create-cases,Cases>> to open and track potential infrastructure issues.

NOTE: You can centrally manage rules from the
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{kib} Management UI] that provides a
set of built-in {kibana-ref}/rule-types.html[rule types] and
{kibana-ref}/action-types.html[connectors] for you to use. Click *Manage Rules*

[[filter-observability-alerts]]
== Filter alerts

To help you get started with your analysis faster, use the KQL bar to create structured queries using
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language]. For example, `kibana.alert.rule.name : <>`.

You can use the time filter to define a specific date and time range. By default, this filter is set to search
for the last 15 minutes.

You can also filter by alert status using the buttons below the KQL bar.
By default, this filter is set to *Show all* alerts, but you can filter to show only *Active* or *Recovered* alerts.
An alert is "Active" when the condition defined in the rule currently matches,
and an alert has "Recovered" when that condition, which previously matched, is currently no longer matching.

[[view--alert-details]]
== View alert details

There are a few ways to inspect the details for a specific alert.

From the Alerts table, you can select image:images/flyout-icon.png[Diagonal line with arrows icon used to open the "View details" flyout,height=22] to open the alert detail flyout to view a summary of the alert without leaving the page.
There you'll see the current status of the alert, its duration, and when it was last updated.
To help you determine what caused the alert, you can view the expected and actual threshold values, and the rule that produced the alert.
