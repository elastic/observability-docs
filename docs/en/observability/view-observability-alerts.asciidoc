experimental[]

****
Given the experimental status of this feature, you may want to disable writing to specific {observability} alert indices
or disable and remove the Alerts page altogether.
For more information on configuring alerts, see <<create-alerts-configure>>.
****

The Alerts page lists all the alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created using
one of the Observability apps.

After alerts have been triggered, you can monitor their activity to verify they are functioning correctly.
In addition, you can filter alerts and troubleshoot each alert in their respective app.

You can also add alerts to <<create-cases,Cases>> to open and track potential infrastructure issues.

NOTE: You can centrally manage rules from the
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{kib} Management UI] that provides a
set of built-in {kibana-ref}/rule-types.html[rule types] and
{kibana-ref}/action-types.html[connectors] for you to use. Click *Manage Rules*.

[[filter-observability-alerts]]
== Filter alerts

To help you get started with your analysis faster, use the KQL bar to create structured queries using
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language]. For example, `kibana.alert.rule.name : <>`.

You can use the time filter to define a specific date and time range. By default, this filter is set to search
for the last 15 minutes.

You can also filter by alert status using the buttons below the KQL bar.
By default, this filter is set to *Show all* alerts, but you can filter to show only *Active* or *Recovered* alerts.
An alert is "Active" when the condition defined in the rule currently matches,
and an alert has "Recovered" when that condition, which previously matched, is currently no longer matching.

NOTE: There is also a "Flapping" status, which means the alert is switching repeatedly between active and recovered states.
This status is possible only if you have enabled alert flapping detection.
For each space, you can choose a look back window and threshold that are used to determine whether alerts are flapping. For example, in *{observability}* > *Alerts* > *Settings* you can specify that the alert must change status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs. If the rule has actions that run when the alert status changes, those actions are suppressed while the alert is flapping.

[[view--alert-details]]
== View alert details

There are a few ways to inspect the details for a specific alert.

From the Alerts table, you can click the text in the *Reason* column to open the alert detail flyout to view a summary of the alert without leaving the page.
There you'll see the current status of the alert, its duration, and when it was last updated.
To help you determine what caused the alert, you can view the expected and actual threshold values, and the rule that produced the alert.

To further inspect the rule:

[[customize-observability-alerts-table]]
== Customize the alerts table

Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the alerts table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Reorder the columns.
* **_x_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns.
* **Fields**: Select the fields to display in the table.

For example, click **Fields** and choose the `kibana.alert.maintenance_window_ids` field.
If an alert was affected by a {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html[maintenance window], its identifier appears in the new column:
