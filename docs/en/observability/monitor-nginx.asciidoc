**New to Elastic?** Follow the steps in our {estc-welcome}/getting-started-observability.html[getting started guide] instead of the steps described here.
Return to this tutorial after you've learned the basics.
****

Use the {integrations-docs}/nginx[nginx Elastic integration] and the {agent} to collect valuable metrics and logs from your nginx instances. Then, use built-in dashboards and tools like Logs Explorer in {kib} to visualize and monitor your nginx data from one place. This data provides valuable insight into your nginx instances—for example:

* A spike in error logs for a certain resource may mean you have a deleted resource that is still needed.
* Access logs can show when a service's peak times are, and, from this, when it might be best to perform things like maintenance.
* A sudden spike in client requests may point to something malicious, like a DDoS attack.

[[monitor-nginx-what-youll-learn]]
== What you'll learn

This guide walks you through using Elastic {observability} to monitor your nginx instances, including:

* Collecting logs and metrics from nginx instances using an {agent} and the nginx integration.
* Centralizing the data in the {stack}.
* Exploring the data in real time using tailored dashboards and {observability} UIs.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-data-types]]
== Data types

The nginx integration collects both logs and metrics.

[horizontal]
*Logs*:: Collect logs to keep a record of events that happen in your nginx instances like when client requests and errors occur.
+
*Access logs* provide information about each request processed by the nginx server. Use these logs for troubleshooting, monitoring performance, and analyzing user behavior.
+
*Error logs* provide diagnostic information about errors that occur when the nginx server is handling requests. Use these logs to understand why errors occur, assess error impact, and debug issues.
*Metrics*:: Collect metrics for insight into the state of your nginx instances.
This includes information like the total number of active client connections by status, the total number of client requests, and more.
Use these metrics to monitor server load, detect bottlenecks, understand client behavior, and plan for capacity.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-prereqs]]
== Before you begin

Before you can monitor nginx, you need the following:

* {es} for storing and searching your observability data
* {kib} for visualizing and managing it.
* If you want to collect metrics, make sure your nginx instance is https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-amplify/nginx-amplify-agent/configuring-metric-collection/[configured for metric collection].

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-add-integration]]
== Step 1: Add the nginx integration

Follow these steps to add the nginx integration to your deployment:

. Select *Add integrations* from your deployment's homepage.
. Enter "nginx" in the search bar, and select the *Nginx* integration.
. Select *Add Nginx* at the top of the integration page.
. Select *Add integration only (skip agent installation)* at the bottom of the page.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-configure-integration]]
== Step 2: Configure the nginx integration

The nginx integration can fetch different logs and metrics from your nginx instances.
From the *Add Nginx integration* page, configure which logs and metrics you want the integration to collect.
Refer to the following sections for more information on configuring the integration.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-collect-logs]]
=== Collect logs

The nginx integration can collect access logs and error logs.

* *Access logs:* Turn this option on to collect logs about client requests.
* *Error logs:* Turn this option on to collect logs about issues nginx encounters with varying severity levels.

Configure the following for both access logs and error logs:

[horizontal]
**Paths**:: The location of your logs.
**Preserve original event**:: Turn on to add a raw copy of the original event to the `event.original` field.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-collect-metrics]]
=== Collect metrics

The nginx integration collects `stub_status` metrics from your instances.
Make sure your nginx instance is https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-amplify/nginx-amplify-agent/configuring-metric-collection/[configured for metric collection].
Configure the following to collect metrics:

[horizontal]
**Hosts**:: The address of the server that Elastic will connect to for collecting metrics.
**Period**:: How frequently to poll for metrics. The default is every 10 seconds.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-add-agent]]
== Step 3: Add {agent}

After you've configured your integration, you need to add an {agent} to your host to collect data and send it to the {stack}.
You have two options for adding the {agent}, **enroll in {fleet}** or **run standalone**.

[horizontal]
<<monitor-nginx-enroll-in-fleet, **Fleet**>>:: Enrolling in {fleet} lets you automatically deploy updates and centrally manage the agent.
<<monitor-nginx-run-standalone,**Standalone**>>:: Standalone agents need to be manually updated on the host where the agent is installed.

For more on

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-enroll-in-fleet]]
=== Enroll in {fleet}

Follow the instructions from the *Add agent* screen to install the {agent} on your host:

. Under *Enroll in Fleet?*, make sure *Enroll in Fleet* is selected.
. Under *Install {agent} on your host*, copy the command for your system and run it on your host. You can reuse the command on multiple hosts.
. After the agent starts on your host, you'll see confirmation that the agent was enrolled in {fleet}.

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-run-standalone]]
=== Run standalone {agent}

Before installing and running the standalone {agent}, you need to create an API key.
To create an {ecloud} API key:

. From the {kib} menu, go to *Stack Management* → *API keys*.
. Select *Create API key*.
. Give the key a name. For example, `nginx API key`.
. Leave the other default options and select *Create API key*.
. In the *Create API key* confirmation dialog, change the dropdown menu setting from `Encoded` to `Beats`.
This sets the API key format for communication between {agent} (which is based on {beats}) and {es}.
. Copy the generated API key and store it in a safe place.

After creating your API key, follow the instructions from the *Add agent* screen to install the {agent} on your host:

. Under *Enroll in Fleet?*, select *Run standalone*.
. Under *Configure the agent*, select *Download Policy*. Save the `elastic-agent.yml` file to a directory on the host where you'll install nginx for monitoring.
. Open the policy file and notice that it contains all of the input, output, and other settings for the nginx and System integrations.
+
Replace:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    username: '${ES_USERNAME}'
    password: '${ES_PASSWORD}'
----
+
with:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    api_key: '<your-api-key>'
----
+
Where `your-api-key` is the key you created previously in this section.
+
If you already have a standalone agent installed on a host with an existing {agent} policy, add the settings from the **Configure the agent** step to your existing `elastic-agent.yml` file.
. Under **Install {agent} on your host**, select the tab for your host operating system and run the commands on your host.
. If you're prompted with `Elastic Agent will be installed at {installation location} and will run as a service. Do you want to continue?` answer `Yes`.
+
If you're prompted with `Do you want to enroll this Agent into Fleet?` answer `no`.
. Run the `status` command to confirm that {agent} is running.
+
[source,yaml]
----
elastic-agent status

┌─ fleet
│  └─ status: (STOPPED) Not enrolled into Fleet
└─ elastic-agent
   └─ status: (HEALTHY) Running
----

[[monitor-nginx-explore-logs-and-metrics]]
== Step 4: Explore your logs and metrics

Use {kib} to view the metric and log data collected by {agent}.
Refer to the following sections for more information on viewing your data:

* <<monitor-nginx-explore-metrics>>
* <<monitor-nginx-explore-logs>>

[discrete]
[[monitor-nginx-explore-metrics]]
=== View metrics

The nginx integration has a built-in dashboard that shows the full picture of your nginx metrics in one place.
To open the nginx dashboard:

. Open the {kib} menu and go to *Management* → *Integrations* → *Installed integrations*.
. Select the *Nginx* card and open the *Assets* tab.
. Select either the `[Metrics Nginx] Overview` dashboard.

The *Metrics Nginx overview* shows visual representations of total requests, processed requests, heartbeat/up, active connections, reading/writing/waiting rates, request rate, accepts and handled rates, and drops rate.
