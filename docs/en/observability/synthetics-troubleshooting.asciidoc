For debugging synthetic tests locally, you can set an environment variable,
`DEBUG=synthetics`, to capture Synthetics agent logs when using the
<<synthetics-command-reference,Synthetics CLI>>.

== Monitors stopped running after upgrading to 8.8.0 or above

Synthetic monitors will stop running if you have gone through this workflow:

. Enabled Monitor Management (in the {uptime-app}) prior to 8.6.0.
. Created a synthetic monitor that is configured to run on Elastic's global managed infrastructure.
. Upgraded to 8.8.0 or above.

This happens because the permissions granted by clicking *Enable Monitor Management* in versions prior to
8.6.0 are not sufficient in versions 8.8.0 and above.

To fix this, a user with <<synthetics-role-setup,admin permissions>> needs to visit the {synthetics-app}
in {kib}. In 8.8.0 and above, the equivalent of "enabling monitor management" happens automatically in the
background when a user with <<synthetics-role-setup,admin permissions>> visits the {synthetics-app}.

If a user _without_ <<synthetics-role-setup,admin permissions>> visits the {synthetics-app} before an admin
has visited it, the user will see a note that says "Only administrators can enable this feature". That
note will persist until an admin user visits the {synthetics-app}.

== No results from a monitor configured to run on a {private-location}

If you have created a {private-location} and configured a monitor to run on that {private-location},
but don't see any results for that monitor in the {synthetics-app}, make sure there is an agent
configured to run against the agent policy.

[NOTE]
=====
If you attempt to assign an agent policy to a {private-location} _before_ configuring an agent to run
against the agent policy, you will see a note in the {synthetics-app} UI that the selected agent policy
has no agents.
=====

When creating a {private-location}, you have to:

. <<synthetics-private-location-fleet-agent>>.
. <<synthetics-private-location-connect,Connect {fleet} to the {stack}>> and enroll an {agent} in {fleet}.
. <<synthetics-private-location-add>> in the {synthetics-app}.

If you do not complete the second item, no agents will be configured to run against the agent policy, and
any monitors configured to run on that {private-location} won't be able to run so there will be no results
in the {synthetics-app}.

To fix this, make sure there is an agent configured to run against the agent policy.
