On this page, you'll learn how to configure and use Universal Profiling. This page covers:

* Prerequisites to setting up Universal Profiling
* Setting up Universal Profiling in your {ecloud} deployment
* Installing the host-agent
* Installing the Universal Profiling Agent integration

We would appreciate feedback on your experience with this product and any other profiling pain points you may have.
See the <<profiling-send-feedback, send feedback>> section of the troubleshooting documentation for more information.

[[profiling-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

Before setting up Universal Profiling, make sure you meet the following requirements:

* An {stack} deployment on http://cloud.elastic.co[{ecloud}] at version 8.7.0 or higher. Universal Profiling is currently only available on Elastic Cloud.
* The workloads you're profiling must be running on Linux machines with x86_64 CPUs and kernel version >= 4.15.
* The Integrations Server must be enabled on your {ecloud} deployment.
* Credentials (username and password) for the `superuser` Elasticsearch role (typically, the `elastic` user).

[[profiling-prereqs-interpreters]]
=== Interpreters

Universal Profiling is a system-wide profiling solution with additional support for PHP, Python, Java (or any JVM language), Go, Rust, C/C++, Node.js/V8, Ruby, and Perl.

The minimum supported versions of each interpreter are:

* JVM/JDK: 7
* Python: 3.6
* V8: 8.1.0
* Perl: 5.28
* PHP: 7.3
* Ruby: 2.5

[[profiling-prereqs-config-example]]
=== Deployment configuration example

The following deployment configuration example was tested to support profiling data from a fleet of up to 500 hosts, each with 8 or 16 CPU cores, for a total of roughly 6000 cores:

[options,header]
|====
| Component | Size per zone (memory)  | Zones
| {es} | 64 GB | 2
| Kibana | 8 GB | 1
| Integrations Server | 8 GB | 1
|====

Even if you're profiling a smaller fleet, we recommend configuring at least two zones for Elasticsearch and 4 GB of memory each for the Integrations Server and Kibana.

[[profiling-set-up-on-cloud]]
== Set up Universal Profiling on an {ecloud} deployment

To set up Universal Profiling on your {ecloud} deployment, you need to:

. <<profiling-enable-kibana, Enable Universal Profiling in {kib}>>
. <<profiling-configure-data-ingestion, Configure data ingestion>>

[discrete]
[[profiling-enable-kibana]]
=== Enable Universal Profiling in Kibana

To enable Universal Profiling in {kib}, complete the following steps:

. Log in to {ess-console}[{ecloud}].
. Find your deployment and click the gear icon to access your deployment.
. Under your deployment name in the left navigation menu, click *Edit*.
. Scroll down to the *Kibana* heading, and click *Edit user settings*:

image::images/kibana-edit-user-settings.png[]
. Add `xpack.profiling.enabled: true` to a new line in the user settings.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/profiling-enable-user-settings.png[]
. Click *Back* at the bottom of the *User settings* pane.
. Scroll to the bottom of the *Edit* page, and click *Save*.

When enabled, you'll find Universal Profiling in {kib} under *Observability* in the navigation menu.

[discrete]
[[profiling-configure-data-ingestion]]
=== Configure data ingestion

After enabling Universal Profiling on your deployment for the first time, select any subheading under **Universal Profiling** in the navigation menu to open the following page:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/profiling-setup-popup.png[]

Click *Set up Universal Profiling* to configure data ingestion.

NOTE: To configure data ingestion, you need elevated privileges, typically the `elastic` user.

If you're upgrading from a previous version with Universal Profiling enabled, see the <<profiling-upgrade,upgrade guide>>.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading, you must remove all existing profiling data.
We still recommend upgrading as the latest version contains several improvements and new features.

[discrete]
[[profiling-install-host-agent]]
== Install the host-agent

The host-agent profiles your fleet. You need to install and configure it on every machine that you want to profile.
The host-agent needs  `root` / `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` privileges to run.

After clicking *Set up Universal Profiling* in the previous step, you'll see the instructions for installing the host-agent.
You can also find these instructions by clicking the *Add data* button in the top-right corner of the page.

The following is an example of the provided instructions for {k8s}:

[[profiling-agent-config-notes]]
=== Host-agent configuration notes

Consider the following when configuring your host-agent:

* The instructions in Kibana work well for testing environments. For production environments, we recommend setting an immutable version.

* The host-agent versioning scheme is **not aligned with the {stack} version scheme**.

* The OS packages downloaded from `releases.prodfiler.com` have a version in their file name.

* You can find a list of container image versions in the
https://container-library.elastic.co/r/observability/profiling-agent[Elastic container library repository].

* For {k8s} deployments, the Helm chart version is already used to configure the same container image, unless
overwritten with the `version` parameter in the Helm values file.

* For {stack} version 8.8 or higher, use `v3` host agents. For version 8.7, use `v2`. `v3` host agents are incompatible with 8.7 {stack} versions.
