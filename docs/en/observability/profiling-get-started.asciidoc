On this page, you'll learn how to configure and use Universal Profiling. This page covers:

* Prerequisites to setting up Universal Profiling
* Setting up Universal Profiling in your {ecloud} deployment
* Installing the host-agent
* Installing the Universal Profiling Agent integration

We would appreciate feedback on your experience with this product and any other profiling pain points you may have.
See the <<profiling-send-feedback, send feedback>> section of the troubleshooting documentation for more information.

[[profiling-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

Before setting up Universal Profiling, make sure you meet the following requirements:

* An {stack} deployment on http://cloud.elastic.co[{ecloud}] at version 8.7.0 or higher. Universal Profiling is currently only available on Elastic Cloud.
* The workloads you're profiling must be running on Linux machines with x86_64 CPUs and kernel version >= 4.15.
* The Integrations Server must be enabled on your {ecloud} deployment.
* Credentials (username and password) for the `superuser` Elasticsearch role (typically, the `elastic` user).

[[profiling-prereqs-interpreters]]
=== Interpreters

Universal Profiling is a system-wide profiling solution with additional support for PHP, Python, Java (or any JVM language), Go, Rust, C/C++, Node.js/V8, Ruby, and Perl.

The minimum supported versions of each interpreter are:

* JVM/JDK: 7
* Python: 3.6
* V8: 8.1.0
* Perl: 5.28
* PHP: 7.3
* Ruby: 2.5

[[profiling-prereqs-config-example]]
=== Deployment configuration example

The following deployment configuration example was tested to support profiling data from a fleet of up to 500 hosts, each with 8 or 16 CPU cores, for a total of roughly 6000 cores:

[options,header]
|====
| Component | Size per zone (memory)  | Zones
| {es} | 64 GB | 2
| Kibana | 8 GB | 1
| Integrations Server | 8 GB | 1
|====

Even if you're profiling a smaller fleet, we recommend configuring at least two zones for Elasticsearch and 4 GB of memory each for the Integrations Server and Kibana.

[[profiling-set-up-on-cloud]]
== Set up Universal Profiling on an {ecloud} deployment

To set up Universal Profiling on your {ecloud} deployment, you need to:

- Enable the Universal Profiling app in Kibana
- Configure data ingestion

[discrete]
[[profiling-enable-kibana]]
=== Enable Universal Profiling in Kibana

You'll receive instructions on enabling Universal Profiling at the email you used in your https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-SWVgvhO7Z_jAfaV9_bFGa0dUZPuX0JORzPGS8SDP7G-dVQ/viewform[sign-up form].

Once enabled, Universal Profiling in Kibana is located under *Observability* in the navigation menu.

[discrete]
[[profiling-configure-data-ingestion]]
=== Configure data ingestion

After enabling Universal Profiling on your deployment for the first time, select any subheading under **Universal Profiling** in the navigation menu to open the following page:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/profiling-setup-popup.png[]

Click *Set up Universal Profiling* to configure data ingestion.

NOTE: To configure data ingestion, you need elevated privileges, typically the `elastic` user.

If you're upgrading from a previous version with Universal Profiling enabled, see the <<profiling-upgrade,upgrade guide>>.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading, you must remove all existing profiling data.
We still recommend upgrading as the latest version contains several improvements and new features.

[discrete]
[[profiling-install-host-agent]]
== Install the host-agent

The host-agent profiles your fleet. You need to install and configure it on every machine that you want to profile.
The host-agent needs  `root` / `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` privileges to run.

After clicking *Set up Universal Profiling* in the previous step, you'll see the instructions for installing the host-agent.
You can also find these instructions by clicking the *Add data* button in the top-right corner of the page.

The following is an example of the provided instructions for {k8s}:

[discrete]
[[profiling-agent-config-notes]]
=== Host-agent configuration notes

Consider the following when configuring your host-agent:

* The instructions in Kibana work well for testing environments. For production environments, we recommend setting an immutable version.

* The host-agent versioning scheme is **not aligned with the {stack} version scheme**.

* The OS packages downloaded from `releases.prodfiler.com` have a version in their file name.

* You can find a list of container image versions in the
https://container-library.elastic.co/r/observability/profiling-agent[Elastic container library repository].

* For {k8s} deployments, the Helm chart version is already used to configure the same container image, unless
overwritten with the `version` parameter in the Helm values file.

* For {stack} version 8.8 or higher, use `v3` host agents. For version 8.7, use `v2`. `v3` host agents are incompatible with 8.7 {stack} versions.

[[profiling-install-integration]]
== Install the Universal Profiling Agent integration

If you do not wish to install the host agent in standalone mode as shown in <<profiling-install-host-agent>>, you can allow the Elastic Agent to orchestrate the installation instead by using the Universal Profiling Agent integration.

To install the Universal Profiling Agent integration, you need to:

. Collect relevant information from the APM configuration.
. Use that information to add the Universal Profiling Agent integration.

See the steps in the following sections for more information.

[discrete]
[[find-apm-configuration]]
=== Collect APM configuration information

{ecloud} runs a hosted version of the {integrations-server} that includes the APM integration.
To find your APM integration and collect the information needed to install the Universal Profiling Agent integration, follow these steps:

. Under **Management** in the {kib} left navigation, go to **Fleet → Agent policies** and select **Elastic Cloud agent policy**.

. Select **Elastic APM** from the **Name** column.

. Under the *General*  heading, find the *Server configuration* section and write down the value in the *URL* field.

. Scroll down to **Agent authorization**. Under **Maximum number of API keys of Agent authentication**, write down the value in the **Secret token** field.

Continue to the next section to use the information you've collected to add the Universal Profiling Agent integration.

[discrete]
[[add-integration]]
=== Add integration

. Under **Management** in the left navigation, select **Integrations**.

. Turn on **Display beta integrations** in the left sidebar.

. In the **Search for integrations** text field, enter `Universal Profiling Agent`.

. Select the **Universal Profiling Agent** card.

. Click **Add Universal Profiling Agent**.

. In **Universal Profiling Agent → Settings**, add the information you collected from the <<find-apm-configuration>> section:
.. Add the URL from <<find-apm-configuration>> to the **Universal Profiling collector endpoint** field.
.. Add the secret token from <<find-apm-configuration>> to the **Authorization** field.

. Click **Save and continue**.
