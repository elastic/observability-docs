== Fields and comparators

The comparators available for conditions depend on the chosen field. The combinations available are:

- Numeric fields: *more than*, *more than or equals*, *less than*, or *less than or equals*.
- Aggregatable fields: *is* and *is not*.
- Non-aggregatable fields: *matches*, *does not match*, *matches phrase*, *does not match phrase*.

There are several key supported use cases. You can create alerts based on fields containing or matching a text pattern,
alerts based on a numeric field and arithmetic operator, or a single alert with multiple conditions.
