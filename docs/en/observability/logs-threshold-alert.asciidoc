[[fields-comparators-logs]]
== Fields and comparators

The comparators available for conditions depend on the chosen field. The combinations available are:

- Numeric fields: *more than*, *more than or equals*, *less than*, or *less than or equals*.
- Aggregatable fields: *is* and *is not*.
- Non-aggregatable fields: *matches*, *does not match*, *matches phrase*, *does not match phrase*.

There are several key supported use cases. You can create rules based on fields containing or matching a text pattern,
rules based on a numeric field and arithmetic operator, or a single rule with multiple conditions.

A different {es} query type backs each of these comparators, and in some scenarios, it is important to know what
these are so that you can configure your rule correctly. The comparators listed above map to the following {es} query types:

- *more than*: *range* using *gt*
- *more than or equals*: *range* using *gte*
- *less than*: *range* using *lt*
- *less than or equals*: *range* using *lte*

- *is* and *is not*: *term*

- *matches* and *does not match*: *match*

- *matches phrase* and *does not match phrase*: *match_phrase*

[[group-by]]
=== Group by

It is possible to set a *group by* for log threshold rules. You may set one or multiple groupings.

When *group by* is set, a composite aggregation is performed against the selected fields. When any of these groups match the selected
rule conditions, an alert fires *per group*.

In scenarios where there are multiple groupings selected, the group name is separated by commas.

For example, if `host.name` and `host.architecture` are selected as group by fields, and there are two hosts (`Host A` and `Host B`)
and two architectures (`Architecture A` and `Architecture B`), the composite aggregation forms multiple groups. We'll focus on the
`Host A, Architecture A` and `Host B, Architecture B` groups.

If the group `Host A, Architecture A` matches the rule conditions, but `Host B, Architecture B` doesn't, one alert is triggered.

Similarly, if there was a single group by selected, for example, `host.name`, and Host A matches the conditions, but Host B doesn't,
one alert is triggered for Host A. If both groups matches the conditions, then two alerts are triggered. 

[IMPORTANT]
=====
When group by fields are selected, but no documents contain the selected field(s) within the given time range of when the alert is triggered,
then you can't determine the group(s). This is relevant when the rule condition is sensitive to a certain number of documents, and
that number might be `0`. For example, when querying if a host has less than five documents matching a condition, an alert is not triggered
due to the host not reporting logs for the duration of the query.

[[chart-previews]]
== Chart previews

To determine how many log entries would match each part of your configuration, you can view a chart preview
for each condition. This is useful for determining how many log entries would match each part of your configuration.
When a group by is set, the chart displays a bar per group. To view the preview, select the arrow next to the condition.

[[ratio-alerts]]
== Ratio rules

To understand how one query compares to another query, create a ratio rule. This type of rule is triggered when a
ratio value meets a specific threshold. The ratio threshold value is the document count of the first query (query A),
divided by the document count of the second query (query B).

The following example triggers an alert when there are twice as many error logs to warning logs.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
As it is not possible to divide by 0, when the document count of query A or query B is 0, it results in an undefined/indeterminate
ratio. In this scenario, no alert is triggered.

[[performance-considerations]]
=== Performance considerations

When setting a *group by*, we recommend using the *more than* comparator for your threshold—this allows our queries to apply eager filtering, leading to significant performance improvements. Otherwise, we suggest using a *group by* field with the lowest cardinality (number of possibilities).

[[es-queries]]
=== {es} queries (advanced)

When a rule check is performed, a query is built based on the configuration of the rule. For the vast majority of cases it
shouldn't be necessary to know what these queries are. However, to determine an optimal configuration or to aid with
debugging, it might be useful to see the structure of these queries. Below is an example {es} query for the following configuration:

[[settings]]
== Settings

With log threshold rules, it's not possible to set an explicit index pattern as part of the configuration. The index pattern is instead inferred from *Log indices*
on the <<configure-data-sources,Settings>> page of the {logs-app}.

With each execution of the rule check, the *Log indices* setting is checked, but it is not stored when the rule is created.

The *Timestamp* field that is set under *Settings* determines which field is used for timestamps in queries.
