[[logs-threshold-alert]]
= Create a logs threshold alert

To use the alerting functionality you need to {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-setup-prerequisites[set up alerting].

You can then select the *Create alert* option, from the *Alerts* actions dropdown.

[[fields-comparators-logs]]
== Fields and comparators

The comparators available for conditions depend on the chosen field. The combinations available are:

- Numeric fields: *more than*, *more than or equals*, *less than*, or *less than or equals*.
- Aggregatable fields: *is* and *is not*.
- Non-aggregatable fields: *matches*, *does not match*, *matches phrase*, *does not match phrase*.

There are several key supported use cases. You can create alerts based on fields containing or matching a text pattern,
alerts based on a numeric field and arithmetic operator, or a single alert with multiple conditions.

A different {es} query type backs each of these comparators, and in some scenarios, it is important to know what these are so that you can configure your alert correctly. The comparators listed above map to the following {es} query types:

- *more than*: *range* using *gt*
- *more than or equals*: *range* using *gte*
- *less than*: *range* using *lt*
- *less than or equals*: *range* using *lte*

- *is* and *is not*: *term*

- *matches* and *does not match*: *match*

- *matches phrase* and *does not match phrase*: *match_phrase*

[[group-by]]
=== Group by

It is possible to set a *group by* for log threshold alerts. You may set one or multiple groupings.

When *group by* is set, a composite aggregation is performed against the selected fields. When any of these groups match the selected alert conditions, an alert fires *per group*.

In scenarios where there are multiple groupings selected, the group name is separated by commas.

For example, if *host.name* and *host.architecture* are selected as group by fields, and there are two hosts (Host A and Host B) and two architectures (Architecture A and Architecture B), the composite aggregation forms multiple groups. We'll focus on the *Host A, Architecture A* and *Host B, Architecture B* groups.

If the group *Host A, Architecture A* matches the alert conditions, but *Host B, Architecture B* doesn't, one alert is triggered.

Similarly, if there was a single group by selected, for example, *host.name*, and Host A matches the conditions, but Host B doesn't, one alert is triggered for Host A. If both groups matches the conditions, then two alerts are triggered. 

[IMPORTANT]
=====
When group by fields are selected, but no documents are containing the selected field(s) within the given time range (of alert execution), then we can't determine the group(s). This is relevant when the alert condition is sensitive to a certain number of documents, and that number might be 0. To use an example, if we want to know that Host A has less than five documents matching a condition, but the host has stopped reporting logs for the entire duration we were querying, no alert is triggered.

[[chart-previews]]
=== Chart previews

To determine how many log entries would match each part of your configuration, you can view a chart preview for each condition. This is useful for determining how many log entries would match each part of your configuration. When a group by is set, the chart displays a bar per group. To view the preview, select the arrow next to the condition.

The shaded area denotes the threshold that has been selected.

[[ratio-alerts]]
=== Ratio alerts

To understand how one query compares to another query, create a ratio alert. This type of alert is triggered when a ratio value meets a specific threshold. The ratio threshold value is the document count of the first query (query A), divided by the document count of the second query (query B).

The following example triggers an alert when there are twice as many error logs to warning logs.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
As it is not possible to divide by 0, when the document count of query A or query B is 0, it results in an undefined/indeterminate ratio. In this scenario, no alert is triggered.

[[settings]]
=== Settings

With log threshold alerts, it's not possible to set an explicit index pattern as part of the configuration. The index pattern is instead inferred from  *Log indices* on the *Settings* page of the {logs-app}.

With each execution of the alert check, the *Log indices* setting is checked; however, it is not stored when the alert is created.

The *Timestamp* field set under *Settings* is used for determining which field we use for timestamps in queries.

[[action-types-logs]]
== Action types

Extend your alerts by connecting them to actions that use the following supported built-in integrations.

[[es-queries]]
==== Elasticsearch queries (advanced)

When an alert check is performed, a query is built based on the alert configuration. For the vast majority of cases it shouldn't be necessary to know what these queries are. However, to determine an optimal configuration or to aid with debugging, it might be useful to see the structure of these queries. Below is an example {es} query for the following configuration:
