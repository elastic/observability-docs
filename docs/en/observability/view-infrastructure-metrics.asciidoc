[[view-infrastructure-metrics]]
= View infrastructure metrics

The *Inventory* page provides a metrics-driven view of your entire infrastructure grouped by 
the resources that you are monitoring. All monitored resources emitting
a core set of infrastructure metrics are displayed to give you a quick view of the overall health
of your infrastructure.

To access this page, go to *Observability > Metrics*. The *Inventory* page is displayed by default.

An overview of the hosts that you are monitoring and the current CPU usage
for each host are displayed in a waffle map of one or more rectangular grids. 
Alternatively, you can change this map view to a table view.

[[filter-resources]]
== Filter related resources

To help you get started with your analysis faster, you can change the high-level view from
hosts to Kubernetes pods, Docker containers, or AWS, which includes EC2 instances, S3 buckets,
RDS databases, and SQS queues. When you hover over each resource, the metrics specific to
that resource are displayed.

You can sort by resource, group the resource by specific fields related to it, and sort by
either name or metric value. For example, you can filter the view to display the memory usage
of your Kubernetes pods, grouped by namespace, and sorted by the memory usage value.

You can also use the search bar to create structured queries using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"`` to see only the information for `host1`.

To examine the metrics for a specific time, use the time filter to select the date and time.

[[custom-metrics]]
== Add custom metrics

If the predefined metrics displayed on the Inventory page for each resource are not
sufficient for your specific use case, you can add and define custom metrics.

Select your resource, and from the *Metrics* view filter, click *Add metric*.

You can also group your resources by custom fields. Select your resource, and then click
*Group by > Custom field*.

[[analyze-resource-metrics]]
== Analyze resource metrics

When you have searched and filtered for a specific resource, you can drill-down to analyze the
metrics relating to it. For example, to view the metrics relating to a particular Kubernetes pod, 
click on the pod displayed in the high-level view, and then select *Kubernetes Pod metrics*.

[[apm-uptime-integration]]
== Integrate with Logs, Uptime, and APM

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs, traces, or uptime information relating to a specific resource.
For example, in the high-level view, when you click a Kubernetes Pod resource, you can choose:

* *Kubernetes Pod logs* to <<monitor-logs,view corresponding logs>> in the {logs-app}.
* *Kubernetes Pod APM traces* to {kibana-ref}/traces.html[view corresponding APM traces] in the {apm-app}.
* *Kubernetes Pod in Uptime* to <<monitor-uptime,view related uptime information>> in the {uptime-app}.
