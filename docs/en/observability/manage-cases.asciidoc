[[new-case-observability]]
== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of issues and share the details with colleagues.

. Go to *Cases* -> *Create new case*.
. Give the case a name, severity, and description.
+
TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax to create formatted text.

. Optionally, add a category, assignees, and tags.
You can add users only if they meet the necessary <<grant-cases-access,prerequisites>>.

. Under External incident management system, select a <<cases-external-connectors,connector>>. If
you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the
default setting is `No connector selected`.
. After you've completed all of the required fields, click *Create case*.

. Optionally add a default value.

. Click *Save field*.

You can subsequently remove or edit custom fields on the *Settings* page.

After you create custom fields, they're added to all new and existing cases.

Existing cases have null values for the new text fields until you set them in each case.

[[add-case-notifications]]
== Add email notifications

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases.

For hosted {kib} on {ess}:

. Add the email domains to the
{cloud}/ec-organizations-notifications-domain-allowlist.html[notifications domain allowlist].
+
--
You do not need to take any more steps to configure an email connector or update
{kib} user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
used by default.
--

For self-managed {kib}:

. Create a preconfigured email connector.
+
--
NOTE: At this time, email notifications support only {kibana-ref}/pre-configured-connectors.html[preconfigured email connectors],
which are defined in the `kibana.yml` file.
--
. Set the `notifications.connectors.default.email` {kib} setting to the name of
your email connector.
. If you want the email notifications to contain links back to the case, you
must configure the {kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[server.publicBaseUrl] setting.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

[float]
[[add-observability-case-files]]
== Add files

After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the *Files* tab:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/case-files.png[A list of files attached to a case]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

The acceptable file types and sizes are affected by your {kibana-ref}/cases-settings.html[{kib} case settings].

To download or delete the file or copy the file hash to your clipboard, open the action menu (â€¦).
The available hash functions are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log.
To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
Uploaded files are also accessible in *{stack-manage-app} > Files*.
When you export cases as {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[saved objects], the case files are not exported.
