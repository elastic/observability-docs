== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of issues and share the details with colleagues.

. Go to *Cases* -> *Create new case*.
. Give the case a name, severity, and description.
+
TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax to create formatted text.

. Optionally, add assignees and tags. You can add users only if they meet the
necessary <<grant-cases-access,prerequisites>>.

. Under External incident management system, select a <<cases-external-connectors,connector>>. If
you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the
default setting is `No connector selected`.
. After you've completed all of the required fields, click *Create case*.
