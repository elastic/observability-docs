Open a new case to keep track of issues and share the details with colleagues.

. Go to *Cases* -> *Create new case*.
. Give the case a name, severity, and description.
+
TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax to create formatted text.

. Optionally, add a category, assignees, and tags.
You can add users only if they meet the necessary <<grant-cases-access,prerequisites>>.

. Under External incident management system, select a <<cases-external-connectors,connector>>. If
you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the
default setting is `No connector selected`.
. After you've completed all of the required fields, click *Create case*.

=== Add files

After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the *Files* tab:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/case-files.png[A list of files attached to a case]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

The acceptable file types and sizes are affected by your {kibana-ref}/cases-settings.html[{kib} case settings].

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log.
To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
Uploaded files are also accessible in *{stack-manage-app} > Files*.
When you export cases as {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[saved objects], the case files are not exported.
