= Open and manage new cases

[[new-case-observability]]
== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of issues and share the details with colleagues.

. Go to *Cases* -> *Create new case*.
. Give the case a name, severity, and description.
+
TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax to create formatted text.

. Optionally, add assignees and tags. You can add users only if they meet the
necessary <<grant-cases-access,prerequisites>>.

. Under External incident management system, select a <<cases-external-connectors,connector>>. If
you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the
default setting is `No connector selected`.
. After you've completed all of the required fields, click *Create case*.

[[add-observability-case-files]]
=== Add files

After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the *Files* tab:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/case-files.png[A list of files attached to a case]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

The acceptable file types and sizes are affected by your {kibana-ref}/cases-settings.html[{kib} case settings].

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log.
To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
Uploaded files are also accessible in *{stack-manage-app} > Files*.
When you export cases as {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[saved objects], the case files are not exported.

[[add-case-notifications]]
== Add email notifications

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases.

For hosted {kib} on {ess}:

. Add the email addresses to the monitoring email allowlist. Follow the steps in
{cloud}/ec-watcher.html#ec-watcher-allowlist[Send alerts by email].
+
--
You do not need to take any more steps to configure an email connector or update
{kib} user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
used by default.
--

For self-managed {kib}:

. Create a preconfigured email connector.
+
--
NOTE: At this time, email notifications support only {kibana-ref}/pre-configured-connectors.html[preconfigured email connectors],
which are defined in the `kibana.yml` file.
--
. Set the `notifications.connectors.default.email` {kib} setting to the name of
your email connector.
. If you want the email notifications to contain links back to the case, you
must configure the {kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[server.publicBaseUrl] setting.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

[[manage-case-observability]]
== Manage existing cases

You can search existing cases and filter them by attributes such as assignees,
severity, status, and tags. You can also select multiple cases and use bulk
actions to delete cases or change their attributes.

To view a case, click on its name. You can then:

* Add a new comment.
* Edit existing comments and the description.
* Add or remove assignees.
* Add a <<cases-external-connectors,connector>> (if you did not select one while creating the case).
* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured).
* Edit tags.
* Change the status.
* Change the severity.
* Remove an alert.
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates.
* Close the case.
* Reopen a closed case.
