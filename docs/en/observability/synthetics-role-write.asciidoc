[[synthetics-role-write]]
=  Writer role

IMPORTANT: To minimize the privileges required by the writer role, use the
<<synthetics-role-setup,setup role>> to enable Monitor Management.
This section assumes another user has already enabled Monitor Management.

For users who need to create, modify, and delete monitors, provide write access.
Two types of write access are outlined below:

* *General write access*: For most users, you can use <<synthetics-write-privileges-general>>,
which grants write access to all {kib} apps and requires little configuration.
* *Limited write access*: If you want to limit write access to the {synthetics-app} only,
you can use <<synthetics-write-privileges-limited>>, which requires additional configuration.

[[synthetics-write-privileges-general]]
= General write access

Create a *writer role*, called something like `synthetics_writer`:

. Start with the `editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role].
This role grants full access to all features in {kib} (including the {observability} solution)
and read-only access to data indices.
+
NOTE: The `editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role] will grant write access
to _all_ {kib} apps. If you want to limit write access to the {synthetics-app} only,
refer to <<synthetics-write-privileges-limited>>.

. _If the user should have permission to create, modify, and delete project monitors_,
they will need an API key that can be used to `push` monitors.
To create API keys, the user will also need _at least one_ of the following privileges in addition to the
privileges included in the `editor` built-in role:

|Type | Privilege | Purpose

| {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster]

| {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster]

[[synthetics-write-privileges-limited]]
= Limited write access

If you want to limit write access to the {synthetics-app} only, do _not_ use the
`editor` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role].

Instead to you can create a writer role, called something like `synthetics_writer_limited`,
and start by granting the following privileges:

[options="header"]
|====
|Type | Privilege | Purpose

| {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Index]
| `synthetics-*`: `read`
| Read-only access to synthetics indices.

| {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Index]
| `.alerts-observability.uptime.alerts-*`: `read`
| Read-only access to synthetics alert indices.

| {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana]
| `Uptime/Synthetics`: `All`
| Access to the {synthetics-app} in {kib}.

Additional privileges will depend on the factors below.

== If using Private Locations

If the user should be able to create and update monitors hosted on
<<synthetics-private-location,Private Locations>>, add the following privileges:

[options="header"]
|====
|Type | Privilege | Purpose

| {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana]
| `Fleet`: `All`
| Access to Fleet in {kib}.

| {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana]
| `Integrations`: `All`
| Access to Integrations in {kib}.

== If using projects

If the user should be able to create and update monitors using
<<choose-projects,projects>>, add _at least one_ of following privileges:
