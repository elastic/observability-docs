[[user-experience]]
= {user-experience}

{user-experience} provides a way to quantify and analyze the perceived performance of your web application.
Unlike testing environments, {user-experience} data reflects real-world user experiences.
Drill down further by looking at data by URL, operating system, browser, and location --
all of which can impact how your application performs on end-user machines.

Powered by the APM Real user monitoring (RUM) agent, all it takes is a few lines of code to begin surfacing key user experience metrics.

[[why-user-experience]]
== Why is {user-experience} important?

Search engines are placing increasing importance on user experience when organically ranking websites.
Elastic makes it easy to view your website data in the context of Google Core Web Vitals --
metrics that score three key areas of user experience: loading performance, visual stability, and interactivity.
These Core Web Vitals are set to become the main performance measurement in Google ranking factors.
If you’re a content-based site that wants to appear in the “Top Stories” section of Google search results,
you must have good Core Web Vitals.

// We don't support business outcome capture yet. For now, this section should focus on CWV.
// Saving this, as it might be useful later:
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every website has goals -- some sites want users to buy a product, sign up for a mailing list, download an app,
// or share something on social media.
// But no matter how great your product is, a poor {user-experience} can negatively impact your goal completion rate.
// For example, in one study, 40% of users said they abandon a website if it takes more than three seconds to load.
// footnote:[Source and more info: https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/[neilpatel.com]]
// In another, Amazon calculated that a page load slowdown of just one second would cut conversions by
// 7% -- costing them $1.6B in sales each year.
// footnote:[Source and more info: https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales[fastcompany.com]]
// In short, a good {user-experience} keeps your users happy and improves your website's odds of success.

[[how-user-experience-works]]
== How does {user-experience} work?

{user-experience} metrics are powered by the {apm-rum-ref}[APM Real User Monitoring (RUM) agent].
The RUM agent uses browser timing APIs, like https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/[Navigation Timing],
https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/[Resource Timing], https://w3c.github.io/paint-timing/[Paint Timing],
and https://w3c.github.io/user-timing/[User Timing], to capture {user-experience}
metrics every time a user hits one of your pages.
This data is stored in {es}, where it can be visualized using {kib}.

The RUM agent can be installed as a dependency to your application, or with just a few lines of JavaScript.
It only takes a few minutes to <<instrument-apps,get started>>.

[[user-experience-page-load]]
=== Page load duration

This high-level overview is your analysis starting point and answers questions like:
How long is my server taking to respond to requests?
How much time is spent parsing and painting that content?
How many page views has my site received?

You won't be able to fix any problems from viewing these metrics alone,
but you'll get a sense of the big picture as you dive deeper into your data.

[[user-experience-metrics]]
=== {user-experience} metrics

{user-experience} metrics help you understand the perceived performance of your website.
For example, first contentful paint is the timestamp when the browser begins rendering content.
In other words, it's around this time that a user first gets feedback that the page is loading.

.Metric reference
====
First contentful paint::
Focusses on the initial rendering and measures the time from when the page starts loading to when
any part of the page's content is displayed on the screen.
The agent uses the https://www.w3.org/TR/paint-timing/#first-contentful-paint[Paint timing API] available
in the browser to capture the timing information.
footnote:[More information: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint[developer.mozilla.org]]

Total blocking time::
The sum of the blocking time (duration above 50 ms) for each long task that occurs between the
First contentful paint and the time when the transaction is completed.
Total blocking time is a great companion metric for https://web.dev/tti/[Time to interactive]
(TTI) which is lab metric and not available in the field through browser APIs.
The agent captures TBT based on the number of long tasks that occurred during the page load lifecycle.
footnote:[More information: https://web.dev/tbt/[web.dev]]

`Long Tasks`::
A long task is any user activity or browser task that monopolize the UI thread for extended periods
(greater than 50 milliseconds) and block other critical tasks (frame rate or input latency)
from being executed.
footnote:[More information: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API[developer.mozilla.org]]

Number of long tasks::
The number of long tasks.

Longest long task duration::
Duration of the longest long task on the page.

Total long tasks duration::
Total duration of all long tasks

These metrics tell an important story about how users experience your website.
But developers shouldn't have to become experts at interpreting and acting on these signals;
they should spend their time reacting to the opportunities that these metrics present.
For that reason (and many others), Elastic has embraced Google Core Web Vitals.

[discrete]
[[user-experience-core-vitals]]
==== Core Web Vitals

https://web.dev/vitals/[Core Web Vitals] is a recent initiative from Google to introduce a new set of
metrics that better categorize good and bad sites by quantifying the real-world user experience.
This is done by looking at three key metrics: loading performance, visual stability, and interactivity:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/web-dev-vitals.png[Web dev vitals (image source: https://web.dev/vitals)]

Image source: https://web.dev/vitals/[web.dev/vitals]

Largest contentful paint (LCP)::
Loading performance. LCP is the timestamp when the main content of a page has likely loaded.
To users, this is the _perceived_ loading speed of your site.
To provide a good user experience, Google recommends an LCP of fewer than 2.5 seconds.
footnote:[Source: https://web.dev/lcp/[web.dev]]

First input delay (FID)::
Load responsiveness. FID measures the time between a user's first interaction with a page, like a click,
and when the page can respond to those interactions.
To provide a good user experience, Google recommends a FID of less than 100 milliseconds.
footnote:[Source: https://web.dev/fid/[web.dev]]

Cumulative layout shift (CLS)::
Visual stability. Is content moving around because of async resource loading or dynamic content additions?
CLS measures these frustrating unexpected layout shifts.
To provide a good user experience, Google recommends a CLS score of less than `.1`.
footnote:[Source: https://web.dev/cls/[web.dev]]

TIP: https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience.html[Beginning in May 2021],
Google will start using Core Web Vitals as part of their ranking algorithm
and will open up the opportunity for websites to rank in the "top stories"
position without needing to leverage https://amp.dev/[AMP].

[[user-experience-distribution]]
=== Load/view distribution

Operating system, browser family, and geographic location can all have a massive impact on how visitors
experience your website.
This data can help you understand when and where your users are visiting from, and can help you
prioritize optimizations -- for example, prioritizing improvements for the most popular browsers visiting your site.

Don't forget, this data also influences search engine page rankings and placement in top stories for content sites --
without requiring the use of AMP.

[[user-experience-errors]]
=== Error breakdown

JavaScript errors can be detrimental to a users experience on your website.
But variation in users' software and hardware makes it nearly impossible to test for every combination.
And, as JavaScript continues to get more and more complex,
the need for user experience monitoring and error reporting only increases.
Error monitoring removes this blindspot by surfacing JavaScript errors that are
occurring on your website in production.

Open error messages in APM for additional analysis tools,
like occurrence rates, transaction ids, user data, and more.
