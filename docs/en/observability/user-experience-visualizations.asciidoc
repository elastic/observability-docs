= Create user experience visualizations

experimental[]

Based on the {user-experience} data from your instrumented applications, you can create various
detailed visualizations for performance distributions of your web applications or a
key performance indicator (KPI) over time, such as page load times, backend times, and many others.

. Go to *Observability > {user-experience}*.
. Click *Analyze data*.
. For data type, select *{user-experience} (RUM)*.
. Under **Report**, choose the type of data you want to analyze:
+
|=== 

| *Performance distribution* | The Performance distribution time-series chart enables you to examine the perceived
performance of your web applications based on the metric you select.

By default, the `page load time` metric is selected. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs with specific metric data.

| *KPI over time* | The KPI over time histogram is a graphical representation of the performance indicators based on
the metric you select.

By default, the `page views` metric is selected. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs
with specific metric data.

|===

. Now let's define your report. Set the time filter as an absolute or relative time.
. Select the web application name and its environment. You can make multiple selections.
. Form the list of available metrics, select the metric you want to analyze:

* Page load time
* Backend time
* First contentful paint
* Total blocking time
* Largest contentful paint
* First input delay
* Cumulative layout shift
+
To learn more about these metrics, see our {observability-guide}/user-experience.html[{user-experience}] documentation.

. From the *Chart type* dropdown, choose the aggregation-based visualization you want to view:

* Bar vertical
* Bar horizontal
* Bar vertical stacked
* Area
* Area stacked
* Line

. Filter the type of data you want to examine.
+
You can filter by `URL`, `Operating system`, `Location`, `Device`, or `Browser family`.
. To further segment the data and view multiple data series on the chart, you can specify a *breakdown*.
+
For a *Performance distribution* report, you can segment the data by the `operating system`, `device`, or `location`.
+
For a *pings* report, segment data by `observer location` or `monitor type`. 

To customise the visualisation further, click *Open in Lens* where you can
modify visualizations with the drag and drop editor. To learn more, see our {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens]
documentation.
