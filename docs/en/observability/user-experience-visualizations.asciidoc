= Create {user-experience} visualizations

experimental[]

Based on the {user-experience} data from your instrumented applications, you can create
detailed visualizations for performance distributions, key performance indicators (KPI) over time,
and for core web vitals of your web applications.

// lint ignore user-experience
. Go to *{observability} > User Experience > Dashboard*.
. Click *Analyze data*.
. For data type, select *{user-experience} (RUM)*.
. Under **Report**, choose the type of data you want to analyze:
+
|===

| *KPI over time* | The KPI over time histogram represents the performance indicators based on
the metric you select.

By default, the `page views` metric is selected. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs
with specific metric data. 

| *Performance distribution* | The Performance distribution time-series chart enables you to examine the perceived
performance of your web applications based on the metric you select.

By default, the `page load time` metric is selected. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs with specific metric data.

| *Core web vitals* | The Core web vitals chart is a graphical representation of key metrics, such as
loading performance, load responsiveness, and visual stability, for each of your web applications.

By default, the `largest contentful paint` metric is selected. Hover over the chart to display crosshairs
with performance indicators for each web application: `poor`, `average`, and `good`.

|===

. Now let's define your report. Set the time filter as an absolute or relative time.
. Select the web application name and its environment. You can make multiple selections.
. From the *Metric* dropdown, choose the metric you want to analyze; available options depend on the previously
selected report type:

* Page views
* Page load time
* Backend time
* First contentful paint
* Total blocking time
* Largest contentful paint
* First input delay
* Cumulative layout shift
* Largest contentful paint
* First input delay
* Cumulative layout shift

To learn more about these metrics, see {observability-guide}/user-experience.html#user-experience-metrics[{user-experience} metrics].

. From the *Chart type* dropdown, choose the aggregation-based visualization you want to view; available options depend on the previously
selected report type:

* Bar vertical
* Bar horizontal
* Bar vertical stacked
* Bar horizontal stacked
* Bar horizontal percentage
* Area
* Area stacked
* Area percentage
* Line

. Filter the type of data you want to examine.
+
Dependent on which report you selected, you can filter by `URL`, `Web application`, `Operating system`,
`Location`, `Device`, or `Browser family`.
. To further segment the data and view multiple data series on the chart, you can specify a *breakdown*.
+
For a *KPI over time* report and a *Performance distribution* report, you can segment the data by the
`browser family`, `operating system`, `location`, or `device`.
+
For a *Core web vitals* report, segment data by `web application`, `browser family`, `operating system`,
`location`, `device` or `URL`. 

To customize the visualization further, click *Open in Lens* where you can
modify visualizations with the drag and drop editor. To learn more, see {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens].
