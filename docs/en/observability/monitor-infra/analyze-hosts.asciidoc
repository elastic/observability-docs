The **Hosts** page provides a metrics-driven view of your entire infrastructure
backed by an easy-to-use interface called Lens. On the **Hosts** page, you can
view health and performance metrics to help you quickly:

* Analyze and compare hosts without having to build new dashboards.
* Identify which hosts trigger the most alerts.
* Troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly.
* View historical data to rule out false alerts and identify root causes.
* Filter and search the data to focus on the hosts you care about the most.

To access this page from the main {kib} menu, go to
**{observability} -> Infrastructure**, and then click **Hosts**. If the view is
not enabled, click **Enable host view** to begin exploring.

The **Hosts** page provides a few different ways to view host metrics:

* Overview tiles show the number of hosts returned by your search plus
averages of key metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and throughput.
* The host list shows all the hosts returned by your search with a
breakdown of metrics for each host. You may need to page through the list or
change the number of rows displayed on each page to see all of your hosts.
* Each host name is an active link to an overview page with additional metrics
about the host, such as CPU usage, load, memory usage, and network traffic.
* The **Metrics** view shows metrics trending over time for the top 20 hosts,
including normalized load, CPU usage, memory usage, network inbound, network
outbound, disk read IOPS, and disk write IOPS. Place your cursor over a line to
view metrics at a specific point in time.

For information about how the metrics on this page are calculated, refer to
<<analyze-hosts-fields>>.

[[analyze-hosts-filter-view]]
== Filter the Hosts view

The **Hosts** page provides several mechanisms for filtering the data on the
page:

* Enter a search query to show metrics that match your search criteria. For example,
to see metrics for all hosts running on linux, enter `host.os.type : "linux".
Otherwise you’ll see metrics for all your monitored hosts.
* Select additional criteria to filter the view:
** In the **Operating System** list, select one or more operating systems
and include (or exclude) metrics for those hosts.
** In the **Cloud Provider** list, select one or more cloud cloud providers to
include (or exclude) metrics for the selected cloud providers.
* Change the date range in the Time Picker, or click and drag on a
visualization to change the date range.
* In the visualizations under **Metrics**, click a point on a line and apply
filters to set other visualizations on the page to the same time and/or host.

To learn more about filtering data in {kib}, refer to
{kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html[{kib} concepts].

[NOTE]
.Limitation on filtering by service names
====
You may see queries where either the expected hosts are not returned, or where returned hosts do not return metrics.
This may happen when your filter returns events that do not contain all of the fields and/or values specified within your search.

For example, if you search for `service.name : myservice`, you will return all hosts where there are events
containing both `service.name : myservice` and where `host.name` exists.
You may find that some metrics show as `0` when there are no events which contain both
`host.name` and `service.name : myservice` and the metric you are looking for -- like `system.memory.actual.used.pct` for Memory Usage.

TIP: You can configure which indices you are searching in the Settings page.

[[analyze-hosts-open-in-lens]]
== Open in Lens

Metrics visualizations are powered by Lens, meaning you can continue your analysis
in Lens if you require more flexibility. Under **Metrics**, hover your cursor
over a visualization, then click the ellipsis icon in the upper-right corner to
open the visualization in Lens.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hosts-open-in-lens.png[Screenshot showing option to open in Lens]

In Lens, you can examine all the fields and formulas used to create the
visualization, make modifications to the visualization, and save your changes.

For more information about using Lens, refer to the
{kibana-ref}/lens.html[{kib} documentation about Lens].

[[analyze-hosts-inspect-data]]
== Inspect and download metrics

On the **Metrics** tab, you can access a text-based view of the data underlying
your metrics visualizations and optionally download the data to a
comma-separated (CSV) file.

Hover your cursor over a visualization, then in the upper-right corner, click
the ellipsis icon to inspect the data.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hosts-inspect.png[Screenshot showing option to inspect data]

In the flyout, click **Download CSV** to download formatted or raw data to a CSV
file.

Notice that you can change the view to **View: Requests** to explore the request
used to fetch the data and the response returned from {es}. You can click links
to further inspect and analyze the request in the **Dev Console** or
**Search Profiler**.

[discrete]
[[analyze-hosts-view-logs]]
== View logs

On the **Logs** tab, view logs for the systems you are monitoring, and search for
specific log entries. Click **Open in Logs** to tail your log files. For more
information, refer to <<tail-logs>>.

[[analyze-hosts-view-alerts]]
== View alerts

On the **Alerts** tab, view active alerts to pinpoint problems. Use this view
to figure out which hosts triggered alerts and identify root causes.

From the **Actions** menu, you can choose to:

* Add the alert to a new or existing case.
* View rule details.
* View alert details.

[[analyze-hosts-fields]]
== Fields used to populate the Hosts page

The **Hosts** page displays metrics from indices that match the index patterns
specified on the **Settings page**. For example, the default patterns are
`metrics-*` and `metricbeat-*`.

The following sections describe the fields used to populate the **Hosts** page
with data.

[[analyze-hosts-fields-metrics]]
=== Metrics

[options="header"]
|====
| Metric                    | Description

| **# of CPUs**             | Number of CPU cores

**Field Calculation**: `count(system.cpu.cores)`

| **CPU Usage**             | Percentage of CPU time spent in states other than Idle and IOWait, normalized by the number of CPU cores.
This includes both time spent on user space and kernel space.

100% means all CPUs of the host are busy.

**Field Calculation**: `avg(system.cpu.user.pct + system.cpu.system.pct) / system.cpu.cores)`

| **Disk Latency**          | Time spent to service disk requests.

**Field Calculation**: `avg(system.diskio.read.time + system.diskio.write.time) / (system.diskio.read.count + system.diskio.write.count)`
| **Disk Read IOPS**        | Average number of bytes read from the device per second.

**Field Calculation:** `counter_rate(max(system.diskio.read.bytes)`
| **Disk Write IOPS**       | Average number of bytes written from the device per second.

**Field Calculation**: `counter_rate(max(system.diskio.write.bytes)`
| **Memory Total**          | Total available memory.

**Field Calculation**: `avg(system.memory.total)`
| **Memory Usage**          | Percentage of main memory usage excluding page cache.

This includes resident memory for all processes plus memory used by the kernel structures and code apart from the page cache.

A high level indicates a situation of memory saturation for the host.
For example, 100% means the main memory is entirely filled with memory that can't be reclaimed, except by swapping out.

**Field Calculation:** `avg(system.memory.actual.used.pct)`
| **Network Inbound (RX)**  | Number of bytes which have been received per second on the public interfaces of the hosts.

**Field Calculation:** `avg(host.network.ingress.bytes / (metricset.period / 1000))`
| **Network Outbound (TX)** | Number of bytes which have been sent per second on the public interfaces of the hosts.

**Field Calculation:** `avg(host.network.egress.bytes / (metricset.period / 1000))`
| **Normalized Load**       | 1 minute load average normalized by the number of CPU cores.

Load average gives an indication of the number of threads that are runnable
(either busy running on CPU, waiting to run or waiting for a blocking IO operation to complete).

100% means the 1 minute load average is equal to the number of CPU cores of the host.
For example, with a 32 CPU cores host, if 1 min load average is 32, the value reported here is 100%.
If 1 min load average is 48, the value reported here is 150%.

**Field Calculation:** `average(system.load.1) / max(system.load.cores)`

[[analyze-hosts-fields-fields]]
=== Fields

[options="header"]
|====
| Field                | Description
| **Name**             | Name of host.

**Field Calculation:** `host.name`
| **Operating System** | Operating System of host.

**Field Calculation:** `host.os.name`
| **Cloud Provider**   | Cloud Provider host is running on.

**Field Calculation:** `cloud.provider`
