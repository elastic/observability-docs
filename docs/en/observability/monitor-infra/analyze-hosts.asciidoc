The **Hosts** page provides a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure backed
by an easy-to-use interface called Lens. On the **Hosts** page, you can view
health and performance metrics to help you quickly:

* Analyze and compare hosts without having to build new dashboards.
* Identify which hosts trigger the most alerts.
* Troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly.
* View historical data to rule out false alerts and identify root causes.
* Filter and search the data to focus on the hosts you care about the most.

To access this page from the main {kib} menu, go to
**{observability} -> Infrastructure**, and then click **Hosts**.

To learn more about the metrics shown on this page, refer to the
<<metrics-reference>> documentation.

The **Hosts** page provides a few different ways to view host metrics:

* Overview tiles show the number of hosts returned by your search plus
averages of key metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and throughput.
* The Host limit controls the maximum number of hosts shown on the page. The
default is 20, which means the page shows data for the top 20 hosts based on the
most recent timestamps. You can increase the host limit to see data for more
hosts, but doing so may impact query performance.
* The Hosts table shows a breakdown of metrics for each host. You may need to
page through the list or change the number of rows displayed on each page to see
all of your hosts.
* Each host name is an active link to an overview page with additional metrics
about the host, such as CPU usage, load, memory usage, and network traffic.
* Table columns are sortable, but note that the sorting behavior is applied to
the already returned data set.
* The **Metrics** view shows metrics trending over time, including normalized
load, CPU usage, memory usage, network inbound, network outbound, disk read
IOPS, and disk write IOPS. Place your cursor over a line to view metrics at a
specific point in time.

[[analyze-hosts-filter-view]]
== Filter the Hosts view

The **Hosts** page provides several mechanisms for filtering the data on the
page:

* Enter a search query to show metrics that match your search criteria. For example,
to see metrics for hosts running on linux, enter `host.os.type : "linux"`.
Otherwise youâ€™ll see metrics for all your monitored hosts (up to the number of
hosts specified by the host limit).
* Select additional criteria to filter the view:
** In the **Operating System** list, select one or more operating systems
and include (or exclude) metrics for those hosts.
** In the **Cloud Provider** list, select one or more cloud cloud providers to
include (or exclude) metrics for the selected cloud providers.
* Change the date range in the Time Picker, or click and drag on a
visualization to change the date range.
* In the visualizations under **Metrics**, click a point on a line and apply
filters to set other visualizations on the page to the same time and/or host.

To learn more about filtering data in {kib}, refer to
{kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html[{kib} concepts].

[[analyze-hosts-open-in-lens]]
== Open in Lens

Metrics visualizations are powered by Lens, meaning you can continue your analysis
in Lens if you require more flexibility. Under **Metrics**, hover your cursor
over a visualization, then click the ellipsis icon in the upper-right corner to
open the visualization in Lens.

In Lens, you can examine all the fields and formulas used to create the
visualization, make modifications to the visualization, and save your changes.

For more information about using Lens, refer to the
{kibana-ref}/lens.html[{kib} documentation about Lens].

[[analyze-hosts-inspect-data]]
== Inspect and download metrics

On the **Metrics** tab, you can access a text-based view of the data underlying
your metrics visualizations and optionally download the data to a
comma-separated (CSV) file.

Hover your cursor over a visualization, then in the upper-right corner, click
the ellipsis icon to inspect the data.

[role="screenshot"]

In the flyout, click **Download CSV** to download formatted or raw data to a CSV
file.

Notice that you can change the view to **View: Requests** to explore the request
used to fetch the data and the response returned from {es}. You can click links
to further inspect and analyze the request in the **Dev Console** or
**Search Profiler**.

[[analyze-hosts-view-logs]]
== View logs

On the **Logs** tab, view logs for the systems you are monitoring and search
for specific log entries. This view shows logs for all of the hosts returned by
the current query.

[role="screenshot"]

TIP: This view uses the log sources and column settings specified in the
Logs app. To add log sources or columns (such as host name), refer to
<<configure-data-sources>>.

Click **Open in Logs** to tail your log files. For more information, refer to
<<tail-logs>>.

[[analyze-hosts-view-alerts]]
== View alerts

On the **Alerts** tab, view active alerts to pinpoint problems. Use this view
to figure out which hosts triggered alerts and identify root causes. This view
shows alerts for all of the hosts returned by the current query.

From the **Actions** menu, you can choose to:

* Add the alert to a new or existing case.
* View rule details.
* View alert details.
