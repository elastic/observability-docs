The *Logs* tab displays logs relating to the container that you have selected. By default, the logs tab displays the following columns.

|===

| *Timestamp* | The timestamp of the log entry from the `timestamp` field.

| *Message* | The message extracted from the document.
The content of this field depends on the type of log message.
If no special log message type is detected, the {ecs-ref}/ecs-base.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]
base field, `message`, is used.

You can customize the logs view by adding a column for an arbitrary field you would like
to filter by. For more information, refer to <<customize-stream-page,Customize Stream>>.
To view the logs in the {logs-app} for a detailed analysis, click *Open in Logs*.
