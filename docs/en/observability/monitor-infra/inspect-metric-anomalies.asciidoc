[[inspect-metric-anomalies]]
= Detect metric anomalies

When the {anomaly-detect} features of {ml} are enabled, you can create {ml} jobs 
to detect and inspect memory usage and network traffic anomalies for hosts and 
Kubernetes pods.

You can model system memory usage, along with inbound and outbound network 
traffic across hosts or pods. You can detect unusual increases in memory usage
and unusually high inbound or outbound traffic across hosts or pods.

[[ml-jobs-hosts]]
== Enable {ml} jobs for hosts or Kubernetes pods

Create a {ml} job to detect anomalous memory usage and network traffic 
automatically.

Once you create {ml} jobs, you can not change the settings. You can 
recreate these jobs later. However, you will remove any previously detected anomalies.

// lint ignore anomaly-detection observability
1. Go to *Observability -> Infrastructure -> Inventory* and click the *Anomaly detection* link at the top of the page.
2. You’ll be prompted to create a {ml} job for *Hosts* or 
*Kubernetes Pods*. Click *Enable*.
3. Choose a start date for the {ml} analysis.
+
{ml-cap} jobs analyze the last four weeks of data and continue to run 
indefinitely.
+
4. Select a partition field.
+
[NOTE]
=====
By default, the Kubernetes partition field `kubernetes.namespace` is selected.
=====
+
Partitions allow you to create independent models for different groups of data 
that share similar behavior. For example, you may want to build separate models 
for machine type or cloud availability zone so that anomalies are not weighted 
equally across groups.
+
5. By default, {ml} jobs analyze all of your metric data, and the results are listed under
the *Anomalies* tab. You can filter this list to view only the jobs or metrics that
you are interested in. For example, you can filter by job name and node name to view
specific {anomaly-detect} jobs for that host.
6. Click *Enable jobs*.
7. You're now ready to explore your metric anomalies. Click *Anomalies*.

+
The *Anomalies* table displays a list of each single metric {anomaly-detect} job
for the specific host or Kubernetes pod. By default, anomaly jobs are sorted by
time to show the most recent job.
+
Along with each anomaly job and the node name, detected anomalies with
a severity score equal to 50 or higher are listed. These scores represent a severity
of "warning" or higher in the selected time period. The *summary* value represents the
increase between the actual value and the expected ("typical") value of the metric in
the anomaly record result.
+
To drill down and analyze the metric anomaly, select *Actions -> Open in Anomaly Explorer*
to view the {ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[Anomaly Explorer in {ml-app}]. You can
also select *Actions -> Show in Inventory* to view the host or Kubernetes pods Inventory
page, filtered by the specific metric.
+
[NOTE]
=====
These predefined {anomaly-jobs} use {ml-docs}/ml-rules.html[custom rules]. To
update the rules in the {ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[Anomaly Explorer], select
*actions -> Configure rules*. The changes only take effect for new results.
If you want to apply the changes to existing results, clone and rerun the job.

[[history-chart]]
== History chart

On the *Inventory* page, click *Show history* to view the metric values within 
the selected time frame. Detected anomalies with an anomaly score equal to 50, 
or higher, are highlighted in red. To examine the detected anomalies, use the 
{ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[Anomaly Explorer].
