[[analyze-metrics]]
= Infrastructure monitoring

The {infrastructure-app} in {kib} enables you to visualize infrastructure
metrics to help diagnose problematic spikes, identify high resource utilization,
automatically discover and track pods, and unify your metrics with logs and APM
data in {es}.

Using {agent} integrations, you can ingest and analyze metrics from servers,
Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestrations, explore and analyze application
telemetries, and more.

| **Inventory**
|Provides a metrics-driven view of your entire infrastructure grouped by the resources that you are monitoring. 

<<view-infrastructure-metrics,Learn more about the Inventory page > >>

| **Metrics Explorer**
| Enables you to create time-series visualizations based on aggregation of your metrics, chart them against related metrics, and break them down per the field of your choice.

<<explore-metrics,Learn more about the Metrics Explorer > >>

| **Hosts**
| Provides a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure backed by an easy-to-use interface called Lens.

By default, the {infrastructure-app} displays metrics from {es} indices that
match the `metrics-*` and `metricbeat-*` index patterns. To learn how to change
this behavior, refer to <<configure-settings>>.

To learn more about the metrics shown in the {infrastructure-app}, refer to
the <<metrics-reference>> documentation.
