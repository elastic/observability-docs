[[view-infrastructure-metrics]]
= View infrastructure metrics by resource type

The *Inventory* page provides a metrics-driven view of your entire infrastructure grouped by 
the resources you are monitoring. All monitored resources emitting
a core set of infrastructure metrics are displayed to give you a quick view of the overall health
of your infrastructure.

To access this page from the main {kib} menu, go to
*{observability} -> Infrastructure -> Inventory*.

To learn more about the metrics shown on this page, refer to the
<<metrics-reference>> documentation.

// tag::add-metrics-tip[]
[TIP]
====
If there are no metrics to display, {kib} prompts you to add a metrics
integration. Click **Add a metrics integration** to get started. If you want to
add more data in the future, click **Add data** from any page in the
{infrastructure-app}.

[[filter-resources]]
== Select and filter the resources displayed on the page

To get started with your analysis, select the type of resources you want to show
in the high-level view. From the *Show* menu, select one of the following:

* *Hosts* (the default)
* *Kubernetes Pods*
* *Docker Containers*
* *AWS*, which includes EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, and SQS queues

When you hover over each resource, the metrics specific to
that resource are displayed.

You can sort by resource, group the resource by specific fields related to it, and sort by
either name or metric value. For example, you can filter the view to display the memory usage
of your Kubernetes pods, grouped by namespace, and sorted by the memory usage value.

You can also use the search bar to create structured queries using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language].
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to view only the information for `host1`.

To examine the metrics for a specific time, use the time filter to select the date and time.

[[analyze-hosts-inventory]]
== View host metrics

By default the *Inventory* page displays a waffle map that shows the hosts you
are monitoring and the current CPU usage for each host.
Alternatively, you can click the *Table view* icon to switch to a table view.

// TODO: Follow up with SMEs: Why does clicking a host in the waffle map vs the
// table behave differently? In the table view, a popup with links appears
// (instead of the flyout opening).

Without leaving the *Inventory* page, you can view enhanced metrics relating to each host
running in your infrastructure. On the waffle map, select a host to display the host metrics
overlay.

TIP: To expand the overlay and view more detail, click *Open as page* in the upper-right corner.

The host details overlay contains the following tabs:

// This is collapsed by default
[%collapsible]
.*Overview*
====

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/metrics-overlay.png[Host metrics]

The *Overview* tab displays metrics about the selected host, including CPU usage,
normalized load, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic, and the log rate.

Change the time range to view metrics over a specific period of time.

Hover over a specific time period on a chart to compare the various metrics at that given time.

//TODO: From testing it seems like the custom metric
//is not shown in the overview. Commenting this sentence out for now until I find out the status of this capability.
//A chart is also displayed for each <<custom-metrics,custom metric>> that you
//have added and defined on the **Inventory** page.

[%collapsible]
.*Metadata*
====

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/metadata-overlay.png[Host metadata]

//TODO: Follow up with SMEs: How does the "pin" feature work? I think we should call out the capability here.

The *Metadata* tab lists all the meta information relating to the host:

* Host information
* Cloud information
* Agent information

All of this information can help when investigating events—for example, filtering by operating system or architecture.

[%collapsible]
.*Processes*
====

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/processes-overlay.png[Host processes]

The *Processes* tab lists the total number of processes (`system.process.summary.total`) running on the host,
along with the total number of processes in these various states:

* Running (`system.process.summary.running`)
* Sleeping (`system.process.summary.sleeping`)
* Stopped (`system.process.summary.stopped`)
* Idle (`system.process.summary.idle`)
* Dead (`system.process.summary.dead`)
* Zombie (`system.process.summary.zombie`)
* Unknown (`system.process.summary.unknown`)

The processes listed in the *Top processes* table are based on an aggregation of the top CPU and the top memory consuming processes.
The number of top processes is controlled by `process.include_top_n.by_cpu` and `process.include_top_n.by_memory`.

|=== 

| *Command* | Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path to the executable, and all the arguments (`system.process.cmdline`).
| *PID* | Process id (`process.pid`).
| *User* | User name (`user.name`).
| *CPU* | The percentage of CPU time spent by the process since the last event (`system.process.cpu.total.pct`).
| *Time* | The time the process started (`system.process.cpu.start_time`). 
| *Memory* | The percentage of memory (`system.process.memory.rss.pct`) the process occupied in main memory (RAM). 
| *State* | The current state of the process and the total number of processes (`system.process.state`). Expected values are: `running`, `sleeping`, `dead`, `stopped`,
`idle`, `zombie`, and `unknown`.

|===

[%collapsible]
.*Logs*
====

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/logs-overlay.png[Host logs]

The *Logs* tab displays logs relating to the host that you have selected. By default, the logs tab displays the following columns. 

|=== 

| *Timestamp* | The timestamp of the log entry from the `timestamp` field. 

| *Message* | The message extracted from the document.
The content of this field depends on the type of log message.
If no special log message type is detected, the {ecs-ref}/ecs-base.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]
base field, `message`, is used.

|=== 

You can customize the logs view by adding a column for an arbitrary field you would like
to filter by. For more information, refer to <<customize-stream-page,Customize Stream>>.
To view the logs in the {logs-app} for a detailed analysis, click *Open in Logs*.
====

[%collapsible]
.*Anomalies*
====

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/anomalies-overlay.png[Anomalies]

The *Anomalies* table displays a list of each single metric {anomaly-detect} job for the specific host. By default, anomaly
jobs are sorted by time to show the most recent job. 

Along with the name of each anomaly job, detected anomalies with a severity score equal to 50, or higher, are listed. These
scores represent a severity of "warning" or higher in the selected time period. The *summary* value represents the increase between
the actual value and the expected ("typical") value of the host metric in the anomaly record result.

To drill down and analyze the metric anomaly, select *Actions > Open in Anomaly Explorer* to view the
{ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[Anomaly Explorer in {ml-app}]. You can also select *Actions > Show in Inventory* to view the host
Inventory page, filtered by the specific metric.

[%collapsible]
.*Osquery*
====

[IMPORTANT]
=====
You must have an active {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-installation.html[{agent}] with an assigned agent policy
that includes the {integrations-docs}/osquery_manager.html[Osquery Manager]
integration and have Osquery {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges] as a user.
=====

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/osquery-overlay.png[Osquery]

The *Osquery* tab allows you to build SQL statements to query your host data.
You can create and run live or saved queries against
the {agent}. Osquery results are stored in {es}
so that you can use the {stack} to search, analyze, and
visualize your host metrics. To create saved queries and add scheduled query groups,
refer to {kibana-ref}/osquery.html[Osquery].

In the example above, we query for the top 5 memory hogs running on the host.
Under the *Results* tab, the total virtual memory size (`total_size` renamed to
`memory_used` to be a little more user friendly) is returned in descending order,
along with the process ID (`pid`), and the process path (`name`).

To view more information about the query, click the *Status* tab. A query status can result in
`success`, `error` (along with an error message), or `pending` (if the {agent} is offline).

Other options include:

* View in Discover to search, filter, and view information about the structure of host metric fields. To learn more, refer to {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover].
* View in Lens to create visualizations based on your host metric fields. To learn more, refer to {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens].
* View the results in full screen mode.
* Add, remove, reorder, and resize columns.
* Sort field names in ascending or descending order.

[[analyze-resource-metrics]]
== View metrics for other resources

When you have searched and filtered for a specific resource, you can drill-down to analyze the
metrics relating to it. For example, when viewing Kubernetes Pods in the high-level view,
click the Pod you want to analyze and select *Kubernetes Pod metrics*.

[[custom-metrics]]
== Add custom metrics

//TODO: Ask reviewers: is this feature working as expected? When I add a metric,
//it's not available in the "Group by" menu and doesn't seem to persist if I
//leave the page and return.

If the predefined metrics displayed on the Inventory page for each resource are not
sufficient for your specific use case, you can add and define custom metrics.

Select your resource, and from the *Metric* filter menu, click *Add metric*.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-custom-metric.png[Add custom metrics]

Your custom metrics are available in the **Group by** filter menu
so that you can group your resources by custom fields.

[discrete]
[[apm-uptime-integration]]
== Integrate with Logs, Uptime, and APM

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs, traces, or uptime information relating to a specific resource.
For example, in the high-level view, when you click a Kubernetes Pod resource, you can choose:

* *Kubernetes Pod logs* to <<monitor-logs,view corresponding logs>> in the {logs-app}.
* *Kubernetes Pod APM traces* to {kibana-ref}/traces.html[view corresponding APM traces] in the {apm-app}.
* *Kubernetes Pod in Uptime* to <<monitor-uptime-synthetics,view related uptime information>> in the {uptime-app}.
