[[view-infrastructure-metrics]]
= View infrastructure metrics by resource type

The *Inventory* page provides a metrics-driven view of your entire infrastructure grouped by
the resources you are monitoring. All monitored resources emitting
a core set of infrastructure metrics are displayed to give you a quick view of the overall health
of your infrastructure.

To access this page from the main {kib} menu, go to
*{observability} -> Infrastructure -> Inventory*.

To learn more about the metrics shown on this page, refer to the
<<metrics-reference>> documentation.

[TIP]
====
If there are no metrics to display, {kib} prompts you to add a metrics
integration. Click **Add a metrics integration** to get started. If you want to
add more data in the future, click **Add data** from any page in the
{infrastructure-app}.

[[filter-resources]]
== Filter the Inventory view

To get started with your analysis, select the type of resources you want to show
in the high-level view. From the *Show* menu, select one of the following:

* *Hosts* — the default
* *Kubernetes Pods*
* *Docker Containers* — shows _all_ containers, not just Docker
* *AWS* — includes EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, and SQS queues

When you hover over each resource in the waffle map, the metrics specific to
that resource are displayed.

You can sort by resource, group the resource by specific fields related to it, and sort by
either name or metric value. For example, you can filter the view to display the memory usage
of your Kubernetes pods, grouped by namespace, and sorted by the memory usage value.

You can also use the search bar to create structured queries using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language].
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to view only the information for `host1`.

To examine the metrics for a specific time, use the time filter to select the date and time.

[[analyze-hosts-inventory]]
== View host metrics

By default the *Inventory* page displays a waffle map that shows the hosts you
are monitoring and the current CPU usage for each host.
Alternatively, you can click the *Table view* icon image:images/table-view-icon.png[]
to switch to a table view.

Without leaving the *Inventory* page, you can view enhanced metrics relating to each host
running in your infrastructure. On the waffle map, select a host to display the host details
overlay.

TIP: To expand the overlay and view more detail, click *Open as page* in the upper-right corner.

The host details overlay contains the following tabs:

include::host-details-partial.asciidoc[]

NOTE: These metrics are also available when viewing hosts on the **Hosts**
page.

[[analyze-containers-inventory]]
== View container metrics

When you select **Docker containers**, the *Inventory* page displays a waffle map that shows the containers you
are monitoring and the current CPU usage for each container.
Alternatively, you can click the *Table view* icon image:images/table-view-icon.png[]
to switch to a table view.

Without leaving the *Inventory* page, you can view enhanced metrics relating to each container
running in your infrastructure.

****
**Why do some containers report 0% or null (-) values in the waffle map?**

The waffle map shows _all_ monitored containers, including containerd,
provided that the data collected from the container has the `container.id` field.
However, the waffle map currently only displays metrics for Docker fields.
This display problem will be resolved in a future release.

On the waffle map, select a container to display the container details
overlay.

TIP: To expand the overlay and view more detail, click *Open as page* in the upper-right corner.

The container details overlay contains the following tabs:

include::container-details-partial.asciidoc[]

[[analyze-resource-metrics]]
== View metrics for other resources

When you have searched and filtered for a specific resource, you can drill down to analyze the
metrics relating to it. For example, when viewing Kubernetes Pods in the high-level view,
click the Pod you want to analyze and select *Kubernetes Pod metrics* to see detailed metrics:

[[custom-metrics]]
== Add custom metrics

If the predefined metrics displayed on the Inventory page for each resource are not
sufficient for your specific use case, you can add and define custom metrics.

Select your resource, and from the *Metric* filter menu, click *Add metric*.

[[apm-uptime-integration]]
== Integrate with Logs, Uptime, and APM

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs, traces, or uptime information relating to a specific resource.
For example, in the high-level view, when you click a Kubernetes Pod resource, you can choose:

* *Kubernetes Pod logs* to <<monitor-logs,view corresponding logs>> in the {logs-app}.
* *Kubernetes Pod APM traces* to <<apm-traces,view corresponding APM traces>> in the APM UI.
* *Kubernetes Pod in Uptime* to <<monitor-uptime-synthetics,view related uptime information>> in the {uptime-app}.
