beta[] The {uptime-app} uses {agent} to run automated synthetic monitoring test suites using a real Chromium browser.
Using the `elastic-agent-complete` Docker container, create a *browser* monitor to mimic the user experience
across multistep journeys and analyze what the browser displays for each step alongside a test script. 

To get started, try out our {agent} using the `elastic-agent-complete` Docker container image. For details, refer
to <<synthetics-quickstart-fleet,Get started using {agent} and {fleet}>>.

Or you might prefer to get started using our customizable Docker project template. This template provides two
types of sample tests: a two-step inline test and a packaged todo application with a custom suite of tests. For
more details, see <<synthetics-quickstart,Get started using Docker>>.
