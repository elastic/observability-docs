You can use the Synthetics Recorder to <<synthetics-create-test>> by interacting with a web page and exporting journey code that reflects all the actions you took.

== Set up

// Rough requirements to cover
Requirements:
* **Elastic Synthetics Recorder**. Download and install the Synthetics Recorder from the release page.
* **Chrome**. Download and install the Chrome browser. This will be needed to ...

== Record a journey

// Rough steps to cover
Enter a starting URL in the search box.
// README: After starting up the application, you may input a URL. This URL will be the starting point of the journey script Elastic Synthetics will create.

Click **Start** and a Chromium window will open on the page you specified. 
Navigate the page to record actions.
// README: Once you start a journey, Elastic Synthetics will record actions based on your interaction with the browser window. This includes clicking on text, navigation, focusing on inputs like buttons and text fields, and more. As you complete your journey, you will see the actions you are generating populate in the Script Recorder's window.

Click pause to ...
// README: The Script Recorder also includes a Pause feature. When you pause the recording session, you may click around the browser window without recording any actions. Un-pause the Recorder to continue recording journey actions.

Click **Stop** to stop recording.

== Edit a journey

// Rough topics to cover
Name step(s)

Edit action

Add an assertion
// README: You can also add assertions to your journey. Use these to make determinations about the state of the page you are testing. Assertions can include checks for things like the visibility of an element, or the contents of a text field.

Delete an action

Split into multiple steps

[discrete]
== Test the journey

// README: At any point during or after the recording process concludes, you may test your script. When you click the Test button, Elastic Synthetics will run the journey you have defined. After the test concludes, the Recorder will display results on a per-step basis.

// Rough topics to cover
Click **Test** to test each action/step in Chromium.

Verify that the actions work in sequence (especially important if you paused in the middle of recording and/or edited the journey after recording it)

[discrete]
== Export

// README: When you are satisfied with the script you have generated, you can save it to file using the Export script button. Additionally, you can display the generated JavaScript code using the Show script feature.

// Rough options to cover
Export journey code (inline?)

Export project(?) code

== Next steps

After you've refined your journey and exported it, use it to create a monitor (<<synthetics-manage-monitors>>).
