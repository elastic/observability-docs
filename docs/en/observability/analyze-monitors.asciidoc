The *Monitoring from* list displays service availability per monitoring location,
along with the amount of time elapsed since data was received from that location.
The availability percentage is the percentage of successful checks made during
the selected time period.

To display a map with each location as a pinpoint, you can toggle the availability view from list
view to map view.

[[uptime-monitor-duration]] 
== Monitor duration 

The *Monitor duration* chart displays the timing for each check that was performed. The visualization
helps you to gain insights into how quickly requests resolve by the targeted endpoint and give you a
sense of how frequently a host or endpoint was down in your selected time span.

Included on this chart is the {anomaly-detect} ({ml}) integration. For more information, see
<<inspect-uptime-duration-anomalies,Inspect Uptime duration anomalies>>.

[[uptime-history-panel]]
== Check history

The *History* table lists the total count of this monitor’s checks for the selected date range.
To help find recent problems on a per-check basis, you can filter by `status`
and `location`.

This table can help you gain insights into more granular details
about recent individual data points that {heartbeat} is logging about your host or endpoint.
