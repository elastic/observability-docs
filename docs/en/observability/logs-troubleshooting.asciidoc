[[logs-troubleshooting-insufficient-priv]]
== User does not have permissions to create API key

If you don't have the required privileges to create an API key, you'll see the following error message:

[source, plaintext]
----
User does not have permissions to create API key.

Required cluster privileges are [`monitor`, `manage_own_api_key`] and
required index privileges are [`auto_configure`, `create_doc`] for
indices [`logs-*-*`, `metrics-*-*`], please add all required privileges
to the role of the authenticated user.
----

[[logs-troubleshooting-insufficient-priv-solution]]
=== Solution

You need to either:

* Have an administrator give you the `monitor` and `manage_own_api_key` cluster privileges and the `auto_configure` and `create_doc` indices privileges. Once you have these privileges, restart the onboarding flow.
* Get an API key from an administrator and manually add the API to the {agent} configuration. See <<logs-stream-agent-config, Configure the {agent}>> for more on manually updating the configuration and adding the API key.

[[logs-troubleshooting-API-key-failed]]
== Failed to create API key

If you don't have the privileges to create `savedObjects` in {kib}, you'll see the following error message:

[source, plaintext]
----

----

[discrete]
[[logs-troubleshooting-API-key-failed-solution]]

You need an administrator to give you the `Saved Objects Management` {kib} privilege to generate the required `observability-onboarding-state` flow state.
Once you have the necessary privileges, restart the onboarding flow.

[[logs-troubleshooting-kib-not-accessible]]
== {kib} not accessible from host

If {kib} is not accessible from the host, you'll see the following error message after pasting the *Install the {agent}* instructions into the host:

[source, plaintext]
----
Failed to connect to {host} port {port} after 0 ms: Connection refused
----

[discrete]
[[logs-troubleshooting-kib-not-accessible-solution]]
=== Solution

The host needs access to {kib}. Port `443` must be open and the deployment's {es} endpoint must be reachable. Locate your project's endpoint from *Help menu (image:images/help-icon.png[]) â†’ Connection details*.

Run the following command, replacing the URL with your endpoint, and you should get an authentication error with more details on resolving your issue:

```shell
curl https://your-endpoint.elastic.cloud
```

[[logs-troubleshooting-download-agent]]
== Download {agent} failed

If the host was able to download the installation script but cannot connect to the public artifact repository, you'll see the following error message:

[source, plaintext]
----
Download Elastic Agent

Failed to download Elastic Agent, see script for error.
----

[discrete]
[[logs-troubleshooting-download-agent-solution]]
=== Solutions

* If the combination of the {agent} version and operating system architecture is not available, you'll see the following error message:
+
[source, plaintext]
----
The requested URL returned error: 404
----
+
To fix this, update the {agent} version in the installation instructions to a known version of the {agent}.
* If the {agent} was fully downloaded previously, you'll see the following error message:
+
[source, plaintext]
----
Error: cannot perform installation as Elastic Agent is already running from this directory
----
+
To fix this, delete previous downloads and restart the onboarding.
* You're an Elastic Cloud Enterprise user without access to the Elastic downloads page.

[[logs-troubleshooting-install-agent]]
== Install {agent} failed

If an {agent} already exists on your host, you'll see the following error message:

[source, plaintext]
----
Install Elastic Agent

Failed to install Elastic Agent, see script for error.
----

[discrete]
[[logs-troubleshooting-install-agent-solution]]
=== Solution
You can uninstall the current {agent} using the `elastic-agent uninstall` command, and run the script again.

WARNING: Uninstalling the current {agent} removes the entire current setup, including the existing configuration.

[[logs-troubleshooting-wait-for-logs]]
== Waiting for Logs to be shipped... step never completes

If the *Waiting for Logs to be shipped...* step never completes, logs are not being shipped to {es}, and there is most likely an issue with your {agent} configuration.

[discrete]
[[logs-troubleshooting-wait-for-logs-solution]]
=== Solution

Inspect the {agent} logs for errors. See the {fleet-guide}/debug-standalone-agents.html#inspect-standalone-agent-logs[Debug standalone {agent}s] documentation for more on finding errors in {agent} logs.
