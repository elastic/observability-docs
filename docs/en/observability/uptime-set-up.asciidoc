= Get started

To set up a synthetic monitor, you need to configure the monitor, run it, and send data back to {es}.
After setup is complete, the data will be available in the {uptime-app} in {kib} to view, analyze, and alert on.

[[uptime-set-up-choose]]
There are three ways to set up a synthetic monitor:

* {heartbeat}
* Project Monitors
* The {uptime-app} UI

Read more about each option below, and choose the approach that works best for you.

[[choose-heartbeat]]
== {heartbeat}

{heartbeat} is a lightweight daemon that you install on a remote server to periodically
check the status of your services and determine if they are available. Performance data is
then gathered and reported back to {heartbeat}, where it's formatted and sent to the {stack}.

This approach is only recommended for <<monitoring-uptime,lightweight checks>>, and
works well for system administrators wanting to configure lightweight
monitors using YAML files. *You should _not_ use this approach to create browser monitors.*
If you want to create browser monitors, use <<choose-projects>> or <<choose-ui>>.

[[choose-projects]]
== Project Monitors

beta[]

With Elastic Project Monitors, you write tests in an external version-controlled
project using YAML for lightweight monitors and JavaScript for browser monitors.
Then, you use the `@elastic/synthetics` NPM library’s `push` command to create
monitors in {kib}.

This approach works well if you want to create both browser monitors and lightweight
monitors. It also allows you to configure and update monitors using a GitOps workflow.

However, **this functionality is in beta and is subject to change.**

[[choose-ui]]
== {uptime-app}

beta[]

The {uptime-app} is an application in {kib}.
You can create monitors directly in the {uptime-app} using the user interface.
To try out this beta functionality, you will need to enable Monitor Management.

This approach works well if you want to configure and update monitors using a
UI in your browser.

However, **this functionality is in beta and is subject to change.**

Get started in <<synthetics-get-started-ui>>.

NOTE: To use the Elastic Synthetics integration, see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent[8.3 documentation]. The Elastic Synthetics integration is similar to the {uptime-app} approach described above, but contains fewer configuration options and does not allow you to run monitors against Elastic's global managed testing locations.
