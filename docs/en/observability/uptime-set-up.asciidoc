[[uptime-set-up]]
= Use lightweight monitors

To set up an uptime monitor, you need to configure the monitor, run it, and send data back to {es}.
After setup is complete, the data will be available in the {uptime-app} in {kib} to view, analyze, and alert on.

== Choose an approach

There are two ways to set up a lightweight monitor: *{heartbeat}* or the *{uptime-app}*.

|===
| **{heartbeat}** | {heartbeat} is a lightweight daemon that you install on a remote server to periodically
check the status of your services and determine if they are available. Performance data is
then gathered and reported back to {heartbeat}, where it's formatted and sent to the {stack}.

This approach is only recommended for <<monitoring-uptime,lightweight checks>>, and
works well for system administrators wanting to configure lightweight
monitors using YAML files.

You should _not_ use this approach to create browser monitors.
Instead, use project monitors with the {uptime-app}.

| **{uptime-app}** | beta[] The {uptime-app} is an application in {kib}.
You can now create monitors directly in the {uptime-app}.
To try out this beta functionality, you will need to enable Monitor Management.

This approach works well if you want to configure and update monitors using a
UI in your browser or using a GitOps workflow.

However, **this functionality is in beta and is subject to change.**

NOTE: To use the Elastic Synthetics integration, see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent[8.3 documentation]. The Elastic Synthetics integration is similar to the {uptime-app} approach described above, but contains fewer configuration options and does not allow you to run monitors against Elastic's global managed testing locations.
