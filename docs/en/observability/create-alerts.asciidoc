= Alerting

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure alerting is already set up in {kib}. For details, see
{kibana-ref}/alerting-setup.html[Setup and prerequisites].

Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions defined by a *rule*
within the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM apps. When a condition is met, the rule
tracks it as an *alert* and responds by triggering one or more *actions*.

Alerts and rules related to {observability} apps including Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM can be managed in the {observability} UI.
You can also manage {observability} app rules alongside rules for other apps from the {kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{kib} Management UI].

== Create rules

The first step when setting up alerts is to create a rule.
To create and manage rules related to {observability} apps,
go to the {observability} *Alerts* page and click *Manage Rules* to navigate to the {observability} Rules page.

You can also create rules directly from the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM apps without leaving the app by
clicking *Alerts and rules* and selecting a rule, or you can select *Manage Rules* to go to the {observability} Rules page.

From the {observability} Rules page, you can manage rules for {observability} apps, including:

* Creating a new rule
* Editing or deleting existing rules
* Updating the status of existing rules (Enabled, Disabled, or Snoozed indefinitely)

NOTE: The {observability} Rules page allows you to set a rule to be "Snoozed indefinitely".
To snooze a rule for a specific time period, you must use the centralized {kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{rules-ui} page].

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in *connectors* for email,
IBM Resilient, Index, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Server log, {sn} ITSM, and Slack.
Also supported is a powerful webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
Connectors allow actions to talk to these services and integrations.

Learn how to create specific types of rules:

* <<logs-threshold-alert,Logs threshold rule>>
* <<infrastructure-threshold-alert,Infrastructure threshold rule>>
* <<metrics-threshold-alert,Metrics threshold rule>>
* <<monitor-status-alert,Monitor status rule>>
* <<tls-certificate-alert,TLS certificate rule>>
* <<duration-anomaly-alert,Uptime duration anomaly rule>>

== View and manage alerts

The *Alerts* page lists all your
alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created
using the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, or APM apps.

Learn more about viewing and managing alerts in <<view-observability-alerts>>.

IMPORTANT: Not all the predefined rules in {stack-manage-app} will generate and
list an alert on the {observability} Alerts page.
Only alerts generated by rules relating to Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM
can be viewed on the Alerts page.
