= Create alerts

Alerting allows you to detect complex conditions within the Logs, Metrics, and Uptime apps
and trigger actions when those conditions are met. Alerting can be centrally managed from
the {kibana-ref}/managing-alerts-and-actions.html[{kib} Management UI] and provides
a set of built-in {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[actions] and alert-types for you to use.

Extend your alerts by connecting them to actions that use built-in integrations for email,
Index, PagerDuty, Server log, ServiceNow, and Slack. Also supported is a powerful
webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
