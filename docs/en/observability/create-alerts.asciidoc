= Alerting

Alerting allows you to detect complex conditions within the Logs, Metrics, and Uptime apps
and trigger actions when those conditions are met. Alerting can be centrally managed from
the {kibana-ref}/managing-alerts-and-actions.html[{kib} Management UI] and provides
a set of built-in {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[actions] and alert-types for you to use.

Extend your alerts by connecting them to actions that use built-in integrations for email,
Index, PagerDuty, Server log, ServiceNow, and Slack. Also supported is a powerful
webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
