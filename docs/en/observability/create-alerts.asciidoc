[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to set up alerting in {kib}. For details, see
{kibana-ref}/alerting-setup.html[Setup and prerequisites].

Alerting enables you to detect complex *conditions* defined by a rule
within the Logs, Metrics, and Uptime apps. When a condition is met, the rule
tracks it as an *alert* and responds by triggering one or more *actions*.

Listed on the <<manage-observability-alerts,Alerts>> page are all of your
observability alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created
using the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, or APM apps.

Alerting can be centrally managed from the
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{kib} Management UI] and provides a
set of built-in {kibana-ref}/rule-types.html[rule types] and
{kibana-ref}/action-types.html[connectors] for you to use.

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in *connectors* for email,
IBM Resilient, Index, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Server log, ServiceNow ITSM, and Slack.
Also supported is a powerful webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
Connectors allow actions to talk to these services and integrations.
