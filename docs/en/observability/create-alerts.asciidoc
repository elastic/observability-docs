[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure Alerting is already set up in {kib}. For details, see
{kibana-ref}/alerting-setup.html[Setup and prerequisites].

Alerting enables you to detect complex *conditions* defined by a rule
within the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM apps. When a condition is met, the rule
tracks it as an *alert* and responds by triggering one or more *actions*.

Listed on the <<view-observability-alerts,Alerts>> page are all of your
observability alerts that have met a condition defined by a rule you created
using the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, or APM apps.

IMPORTANT: Not all of the predefined rules in Stack Management will generate and 
list an alert on the Alerts page. Only alerts generated by rules relating to Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM
can be viewed on the Alerts page.

Alerting can be centrally managed from the
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html[{kib} Management UI] and provides a
set of built-in {kibana-ref}/rule-types.html[rule types] and
{kibana-ref}/action-types.html[connectors] for you to use.

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in *connectors* for email,
IBM Resilient, Index, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Server log, ServiceNow ITSM, and Slack.
Also supported is a powerful webhook output letting you tie into other third-party systems.
Connectors allow actions to talk to these services and integrations.
