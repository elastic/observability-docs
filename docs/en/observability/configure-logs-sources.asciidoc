[[configure-data-sources]]
= Configure data sources

Specify the source configuration for logs in the
{kibana-ref}/logs-ui-settings-kb.html[{logs-app} settings] in the
{kibana-ref}/settings.html[{kib} configuration file].
By default, the configuration uses the `filebeat-*` index pattern to query the data.
The configuration also defines field settings for things like timestamps
and container names, and the default columns displayed in the logs stream.

If your logs have custom index patterns, use non-default field settings, or contain
parsed fields that you want to expose as individual columns, you can override the
default configuration settings.

| *Name* | Name of the source configuration. 

| *{ipm-cap}* | {kib} index patterns or index name patterns in the {es} indices
to read log data from.

Each log source now integrates with {kib} index patterns which support creating and
querying {kibana-ref}/managing-data-views.html[runtime fields]. You can continue
to use log sources configured to use an index name pattern, such as `filebeat-*`,
instead of a {kib} index pattern. However, some features like those depending on
runtime fields may not be available.

Instead of entering an index pattern name,
click *Use {kib} index patterns* and select the `filebeat-*` log index pattern.

| *{data-source-cap}* | This is a new configuration option that can be used
instead of index pattern. The Logs UI can now integrate with {data-sources} to
configure the used indices by clicking *Use {data-sources}*.

| *Fields* | Configuring fields input has been deprecated. You should adjust your indexing using the
<<logs-app-fields,{logs-app} fields>>, which use the {ecs-ref}/index.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS) specification].

| *Log columns* | Columns that are displayed in the logs *Stream* page.

[TIP]
===============================
If {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Spaces] are enabled in your {kib} instance,
any configuration changes you make here are specific to the current space.
You can make different subsets of data available by creating multiple spaces
with other data source configurations.
===============================

By default, the *Stream* page within the {logs-app} displays the following columns.

|=== 

| *Timestamp* | The timestamp of the log entry from the `timestamp` field. 

| *Message* | The message extracted from the document.
The content of this field depends on the type of log message.
If no special log message type is detected, the {ecs-ref}/ecs-base.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]
base field, `message`, is used.

|=== 

1. To add a new column to the logs stream, select *Settings > Add column*.
2. In the list of available fields, select the field you want to add.
To filter the field list by that name, you can start typing a field name in the search box.
3. To remove an existing column, click the *Remove this column* icon.
4. When you have completed your changes, click *Apply*.

If the fields are grayed out and cannot be edited, you may not have sufficient privileges
to modify the source configuration. For more information, see {kibana-ref}/xpack-security-authorization.html[Granting access to {kib}].
