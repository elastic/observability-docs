[[synthetics-create-test]]
= Write a synthetic test

[[synthetics-syntax]]

beta[] To write synthetic tests for your application, you'll need to know basic JavaScript and
{playwright-url}[Playwright] syntax.

TIP: {playwright-url}[Playwright] is a browser testing library developed by Microsoft.
It's fast, reliable, and features a modern API that automatically waits for page elements to be ready.

The synthetics agent exposes an API for creating and running tests, including:

[horizontal]
`journey`::     Tests one discrete unit of functionality.
                Takes two parameters: a `name` (string) and a `callback` (function).
                See <<synthetics-create-journey>>.
`step`::        Actions within a journey that should be completed in a specific order.
                Takes two parameters: a `name` (string) and a `callback` (function).
                See <<synthetics-create-step>>.
`beforeAll`::   Runs a provided function once, before any `journey` runs.
                If the provided function is a promise, the runner will wait for the
                promise to resolve before invoking the `journey`.
                Takes one parameter: a `callback` (function).
                See <<before-after>>.
`before`::      Runs a provided function before a single `journey` runs.
                Takes one parameter: a `callback` (function).
                See <<before-after>>.
`afterAll`::    Runs a provided function once, after all the `journey` runs have completed.
                Takes one parameter: a `callback` (function).
                See <<before-after>>.
`after`::       Runs a provided function after a single `journey` has completed.
                Takes one parameter: a `callback` (function).
                See <<before-after>>.
`monitor`::     The `monitor.use` method allows you to determine a monitor's configuration on a journey-by-journey basis.
                If you want two journeys to create monitors with different intervals, for example, you should call
                `monitor.use` in each of them and set the `schedule` property to different values in each.
                Note that this is only relevant when using the `push` command to create monitors in {kib}.
                See the "Project monitors" option in <<synthetic-run-tests>>.

[[synthetics-initialize]]
== Initialize a synthetic project

Start by installing the Elastic Synthetics agent:

[source,sh]
----
npm install -g @elastic/synthetics
----

Then create a Node.js project using the `@elastic/synthetics` `init` command.
This will create a template Node.js project that includes the synthetics agent, required dependencies,
a synthetics configuration file, and example journey files:

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics init <name-of-your-project>
----

Once you have a project set up, you can start writing journeys and pushing them to create monitors.

[[synthetics-create-journey]]
== Create a journey

Create a new file using the `.journey.ts` or `.journey.js` file extension or edit one of the example journey files.

A _journey_ tests one discrete unit of functionality.
For example, logging into a website, adding something to a cart, or joining a mailing list.

The journey function takes two parameters: a `name` and a `callback`.
The `name` helps you identify an individual journey.
The `callback` argument is a function that encapsulates what the journey does.
The callback provides access to fresh Playwright `page`, `params`, `browser`, and `context` instances.

[source,js]
----
journey('Journey name', ({ page, browser, context, params, request }) => {
  // Add steps here
});
----

[horizontal]
`name`::        A user-defined string to describe the journey.
`page`::        A https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page[page] object from Playwright
                that lets you control the browser's current page.
`browser`::     A {playwright-api-docs}[browser] object created by Playwright.
`context`::     A https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext[browser context] 
                that doesn't share cookies or cache with other browser contexts.
`params`::      User-defined variables that allow you to invoke the Synthetics suite with custom parameters.
                For example, if you want to use a different homepage depending on the `env`
                (`localhost` for `dev` and a URL for `prod`). See <<synthetics-params-secrets>>
                for more information.
`request`::     A request object that can be used to make API requests independently of the browser
                interactions. For example, to get authentication credentials or tokens in service of a
                browser-based test. See <<synthetics-request-param>> for more information.

[[synthetics-create-step]]
== Add steps

A journey consists of one or more _steps_. Steps are actions that should be completed in a specific order.
Steps are displayed individually in the {uptime-app} along with screenshots for convenient debugging and error tracking.

A basic two-step journey would look like this:

[source,js]
----
journey('Journey name', ({ page, browser, client, params, request }) => {
    step('Step 1 name', () => {
      // Do something here
    });
    step('Step 2 name', () => {
      // Do something else here
    });
});
----

Steps can be as simple or complex as you need them to be.
For example, a basic first step might load a web page:

[source,js]
----
step('Load the demo page', () => {
  await page.goto('https://elastic.github.io/synthetics-demo/'); <1>
});
----
<1> See the https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-goto[`page.goto` reference] for more information.

A more complex step might wait for a page element to be selected
and then make sure that it matches an expected value.

For example, on a page using the following HTML:

[source,html]
----
<header class="header">
  <h1>todos</h1>
  <input class="new-todo"
    autofocus autocomplete="off"
    placeholder="What needs to be done?">
</header>
----

You can verify that the `input` element with class `new-todo` has the expected `placeholder` value
(the hint text for `input` elements) with the following test:

[source,js]
----
step('Assert placeholder text', async () => {
  const placeholderValue = await page.getAttribute(
      'input.new-todo',
      'placeholder'
  ); <1>
  expect(placeholderValue).toBe('What needs to be done?'); <2>
});
----
<1> Find the `input` element with class `new-todo` and get the value of the `placeholder` attribute.
See the https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-get-attribute[`page.getAttribute` reference] for more information.
<2> Use the assertion library provided by the Synthetics agent to look for the
expected value. See https://jestjs.io/docs/expect[Jest expect docs] for more information.

[[synthetics-create-test-script-recorder]]
=== Synthetics Recorder

beta[]

If you want to generate code by interacting with a web page directly, you can use the Synthetics Recorder.

The recorder launches a https://www.chromium.org/Home/[Chromium browser] that will listen to each interaction you have with the web page and record them internally using Playwright.
When you're done interacting with the browser, the recorder converts the recorded actions into JavaScript code that you can use with Elastic Synthetics or {heartbeat}.

For more details on getting started with the Synthetics Recorder, see <<synthetics-recorder>>.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-request-param]]
== Make API requests

You can use the `request` parameter to make API requests independently of browser interactions.
For example, you could retrieve a token from an HTTP endpoint and use it in a subsequent webpage request.

[source,js]
----
step('make an API request', async () => {
  const response = await request.get(params.url);
  // Do something with the response
})
----

The Elastic Synthetics `request` parameter is similar to https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext[other request objects that are exposed by Playwright]
with a few key differences:

* The Elastic Synthetics `request` parameter comes built into the library so it doesn't
have to be imported separately, which reduces the lines of code needed and allows you to
make API requests in inline journeys.
* The top level `request` object exposed by Elastic Synthetics has its own isolated cookie storage
unlike Playwright's `context.request` and `page.request`, which share cookie storage
with the corresponding https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext[`BrowserContext`].
* If you want to control the creation of the `request` object, you can do so by passing options
via <<elastic-synthetics-command, `--playwright-options`>> or in the
<<synthetics-configuration, `synthetics.config.ts` file>>.

NOTE: The `request` parameter is not intended to be used for writing pure API tests. Instead, it is a way to support
writing plain HTTP requests in service of a browser-based test.

[discrete]
[[before-after]]
== Set up and remove a global state

If there are any actions that should be done before or after journeys, you can use `before`, `beforeAll`, `after`, or `afterAll`.

To set up global state or a server that will be used for a **single** `journey`, for example,
use a `before` hook. To perform this setup once before **all** journeys, use a `beforeAll` hook.

[source,js]
----
before(({ params }) => {
  // Actions to take
});

beforeAll(({ params }) => {
  // Actions to take
});
----

You can clean up global state or close a server used for a **single** `journey` using an `after` hook.
To perform this cleanup once after all journeys, use an `afterAll` hook.

[source,js]
----
after(({ params }) => {
  // Actions to take
});

afterAll(({ params }) => {
  // Actions to take
});
----

[discrete]
[[synthetics-sample-test]]
== Sample synthetic test

A complete example of a basic synthetic test looks like this:

[source,js]
----
import { journey, step, expect } from '@elastic/synthetics';

journey('Ensure placeholder is correct', ({ page }) => {
  step('Load the demo page', async () => {
    await page.goto('https://elastic.github.io/synthetics-demo/');
  });
  step('Assert placeholder text', async () => {
    const placeholderValue = await page.getAttribute(
      'input.new-todo',
      'placeholder'
    );
    expect(placeholderValue).toBe('What needs to be done?');
  });
});
----

For more information on using `monitor`, see the "Project monitors" option in <<synthetic-run-tests>>.

[[synthetics-test-suite]]
== Test locally

As you write journeys, you can run them locally to verify they work as expected. Then, you can create monitors to run your journeys at a regular interval.

To test all the journeys in a project, navigate into the directory containing the synthetics project and run the journeys in there.
By default, the `@elastic/synthetics` runner will only run files matching the filename `*.journey.(ts|js)*`.

[source,sh]
----
# Run tests on the current directory. The dot `.` indicates
# that it should run all tests in the current directory.
npx @elastic/synthetics .
----

[discrete]
[[synthetics-test-inline]]
=== Test an inline monitor

To test an inline monitor's journey locally, pipe the inline journey into the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command.

Assume, for example, that your inline monitor includes the following code:

[source,js]
----
step('load homepage', async () => {
    await page.goto('https://www.elastic.co');
});
step('hover over products menu', async () => {
    await page.hover('css=[data-nav-item=products]');
});
----

To run that journey locally, you can save that code to a file and pipe the file's contents into `@elastic-synthetics`:

[source,sh]
----
cat path/to/sample.js | npx @elastic/synthetics --inline
----

And you'll get a response like the following:

[source,sh]
----
Journey: inline
   ✓  Step: 'load homepage' succeeded (1831 ms)
   ✓  Step: 'hover over products menu' succeeded (97 ms)

 2 passed (2511 ms)
----
