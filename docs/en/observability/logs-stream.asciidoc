[[logs-stream]]
= Stream a log file

In this guide, you'll learn how to send a log file to Elasticsearch using a standalone {agent}, configure the {agent} and your data streams using the `elastic-agent.yml` file, and query your logs using the data streams you've set up. Once your log files are in {es}, see the <<logs-stream-enhance-logs>> section to learn how to parse your log data and extract fields so you can filter and sort your logs effectively.

[[logs-stream-install-config-agent]]
= Install and configure the standalone {agent}

Complete these steps to install and configure the standalone {agent} and send your log data to {es}:

. <<logs-stream-extract-agent, Download and extract the {agent} installation package.>>
. <<logs-stream-install-agent, Install and start the {agent}.>>
. <<logs-stream-agent-config, Configure the {agent}.>>

[[logs-stream-extract-agent]]
== Step 1: Download and extract the {agent} installation package

On your host, download and extract the installation package that corresponds with your system:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/download-widget.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-install-agent]]
== Step 2: Install and start the {agent}
After downloading and extracting the installation package, you're ready to install the {agent}. From the agent directory, run the install command that corresponds with your system:

NOTE: On macOS, Linux (tar package), and Windows, run the `install` command to
install and start {agent} as a managed service and start the service. The DEB and RPM
packages include a service unit for Linux systems with
systemd, For these systems, you must enable and start the service.

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/run-standalone-widget.asciidoc[]

During installation, you're prompted with some questions:

. When asked if you want to install the agent as a service, enter `Y`. 
. When asked if you want to enroll the agent in Fleet, enter `n`.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-agent-config]]
== Step 3: Configure the {agent}

With your agent installed, configure it by updating the `elastic-agent.yml` file. 

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-yml-location]]
=== Locate your configuration file

After installing the agent, you'll find the `elastic-agent.yml` in one of the following locations according to your system:

include::tab-widgets/logs/agent-location-widget.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-example-config]]
=== Update your configuration file

The following is an example of a standalone {agent} configuration. To configure your {agent}, replace the contents of the `elastic-agent.yml` file with this configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts: '<your-elasticsearch-endpoint>:<port>'
    api_key: 'your-api-key'
inputs:
  - id: your-log-id
    type: filestream
    streams:
      - id: your-log-stream-id
        data_stream:
          dataset: generic
        paths:
          - /var/log/your-logs.log
----

Next, set the values for these fields:

- `hosts` – Copy the {es} endpoint from your deployment's page and add the port (the default port is `443`). For example, `https://my-deployment.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443`.
+
--
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/es-endpoint-cluster-id.png[{es} endpoint and cluster id location, 50%]
--
- `api-key` – Use an API key to grant the agent access to {es}. To create an API key for your agent, see {fleet-guide}/grant-access-to-elasticsearch.html#create-api-key-standalone-agent[Create API keys for standalone agents].
+
NOTE: The API key format should be `<id>:<key>`. Make sure you selected *Beats* when you created your API key. Base64 encoded API keys are not currently supported in this configuration.
- `inputs.id` – A unique identifier for your input.
- `type` – The type of input. For collecting logs, set this to `filestream`.
- `streams.id` – A unique identifier for your stream of log data. 
- `data_stream.dataset` – The name for your dataset data stream. Name this data stream anything that signifies the source of the data. The default value is `generic`.
- `paths` – The path to your log files. You can also use a pattern like `/var/log/your-logs.log*`.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-restart-agent]]
=== Restart the {agent}

After updating your configuration file, you need to restart the {agent}:

First, stop the {agent} and its related executables using the command that works with your system:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/stop-widget.asciidoc[]

Next, restart the {agent} using the command that works with your system:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/start-widget.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-query-datastreams]]
= View and search your data

With your {agent} and data streams configured, you can now view, filter, and search your log data. In {kib}, navigate to *Observability → Logs → Stream*, and use the search bar to search for your `data_stream.type` and `data_stream.dataset`. 

See the following examples for ways to search specific data types and datasets:

- `data_stream.type: logs` – shows `logs` data streams.
- `data_stream.dataset: nginx.access` – shows data streams with an `nginx.access` dataset.

This example shows the search results for logs with an `apm.error` dataset and a `default` namespace:

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-troubleshooting]]
= Troubleshoot your {agent} configuration

If you're not seeing your log files in {kib}, verify the following in the `elastic-agent.yml` file:

- The path to your logs file under `paths` is correct.
- Your API key is in `<id>:<key>` format. If not, your API key may be in an unsupported format, and you'll need to create an API key in *Beats* format. 

If you're still running into issues, see {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{agent} troubleshooting] and {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-configuration.html[Configure standalone Elastic Agents].

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-enhance-logs]]
= Get the most out of your log data

Make your logs more useful by extracting structured fields from your unstructured log data. Extracting structured fields makes it easier to search, analyze, and filter your log data. 

Let's look at this log example:

[source,log]
----
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
----

Add this log to {es} using the following command in *Dev Tools*, found in your deployment in the left navigation under *Management*:

[source,console]
----
POST logs-test-default/_doc
{
  "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
}
----

Use the this command to look at the document's details:

[source,console]
----
GET /logs-test-default/_search
----

You see something like this:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    ...
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-test-default-2023.08.09-000001",
        "_id": "RsWy3IkB8yCtA5VGOKLf",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-09T17:19:27.73312243Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Notice the text in your message isn't parsed, so you can't filter by any individual fields. Also, the `@timestamp` field shows when you added the data to {es}, not when the log occurred. In this format, you can search for keywords like `WARN` or `Disk usage exceeds`, but the fields are not useful for sorting or filtering. Your message, however, contains all of these potential fields:

- *@timestamp* – `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z` – Extracting this field lets you sort logs by date and time. This is helpful when you want to view your logs in the order that they occurred or identify when issues happened.
- *log.level* – `WARN` – Extracting this field lets you filter logs by severity. This is helpful if you want to focus on high-severity WARN or ERROR-level logs, and reduce noise by filtering out low-severity INFO-level logs.
- *host.ip* – `192.168.1.101` – Extracting this field lets you filter logs by the host IP addresses. This is helpful if you want to focus on specific hosts that you’re having issues with or if you want to find disparities between hosts.
- *message* – `Disk usage exceeds 90%.` – You can search for keywords in the message field.

NOTE: These fields are part of the {ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]. The ECS defines a common set of fields that you can use across Elasticsearch when storing data, including log and metric data.

[[logs-stream-extract-timestamp]]
== Extract the `@timestamp` field

This section shows you how to extract the `@timestamp` field from this example log:

[source,log]
----
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
----

To extract the timestamp you need to:

- <<logs-stream-ingest-pipeline>>
- <<logs-stream-simulate-api>>
- <<logs-stream-index-template>>
- <<logs-stream-create-data-stream>>

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-ingest-pipeline]]
=== Use an ingest pipeline to extract the `@timestamp`

To extract the `@timestamp` field from the example log, use an ingest pipeline with a dissect processor. The {ref}/dissect-processor.html[dissect processor] extracts structured fields from your unstructured log message based the pattern you set. In the following example command, the dissect processor extracts the timestamp to the `@timestamp` field. 

{es} can parse string timestamps that are in `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ` and `yyyy-MM-dd` formats into date fields. Since the log example's timestamp is in one of these formats, you don't need additional processors. If your log timestamps are more complex or use a nonstandard format, you need a {ref}/date-processor.html[date processor] to parse the timestamp into a date field. You can also use a date processor to set the timezone, change the target field, and change the output format of the timestamp.

This command creates an ingest pipeline with a dissect processor:

[source,console]
----
PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default
{
  "description": "Extracts the timestamp from log",
  "processors": [
    {
      "dissect": {
        "field": "message",
        "pattern": "%{@timestamp} %{message}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Set these values for your pipeline:
- `_ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default` – The name of the pipeline,`logs-example-default`, needs to match the name of your data stream. You'll set up your data stream in the next section. See the {fleet-guide}/data-streams.html#data-streams-naming-scheme[data stream naming scheme] for more information.
- `field` – The field you're extracting data from, `message` in this case.
- `pattern`– The pattern of the elements in your log data. The following pattern extracts the timestamp, `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z`, to the `@timestamp` field, while the rest of the message, `WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.`, stays in the `message` field.
+
[source,JSON]
----
%{timestamp} %{message}
----

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-simulate-api]]
=== Test your pipeline with the simulate pipeline API

Make sure your pipeline is working as expected with the {ref}/simulate-pipeline-api.html#ingest-verbose-param[simulate pipeline API]. Run this command to test your pipeline:

[source,console]
----
POST _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": {
        "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

The results should show the `@timestamp` field extracted from the `message` field:

[source,console]
----
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "doc": {
        "_index": "_index",
        "_id": "_id",
        "_version": "-3",
        "_source": {
          "message": "WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z"
        },
          "_ingest": {
            "timestamp": "2023-08-10T20:37:29.090624429Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

NOTE: Create the index pipeline using the `PUT` command in the previous section before using the simulate pipeline API.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-index-template]]
=== Configure your data stream with an index template

After creating your ingest pipeline, create an index template to point your log data to your pipeline using this command:

[source,console]
----
PUT _index_template/logs-example-default-template
{
  "index_patterns": [ "logs-example-default" ],
  "data_stream": { },
  "priority": 500,
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "index.default_pipeline":"logs-example-default"
    }
  }
}
----

Set the following values for the index template:

- `index_patterns`– The index pattern needs to match your log data stream. Naming conventions for data streams are `<type>-<dataset>-<namespace>`. In this example, your logs data stream is named `logs-example-default`. Data that matches this pattern will go through your pipeline.
- `data_stream` – Enables data streams.
- `priority` – Index templates with higher priority take precedence over lower priority. If a data stream matches multiple index templates, the template with the higher priority is used. Built-in templates have a priority of `200`, so we recommend a priority higher than `200`.
- `index.default_pipeline` – The name of your ingest pipeline. `logs-example-default` in this case.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-create-data-stream]]
=== Create your data stream

Create your data stream using the {fleet-guide}/data-streams.html#data-streams-naming-scheme[data stream naming scheme]. The name needs to match the name of your pipeline. For this example, we'll name the data stream `logs-example-default` and use the example log:

[source,console]
----
POST logs-example-default/_doc
{
  "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
}
----

Now look at your document's details using this command:

[source,console]
----
GET /logs-example-default/_search
----

You can see the pipeline extracted the `@timestamp` field:

[source,JSON]
----
{
...
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    ...
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".ds-logs-example-default-2023.08.09-000001",
        "_id": "RsWy3IkB8yCtA5VGOKLf",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "message": "WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.",
          "@timestamp": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

You can now use the `@timestamp` field to sort your logs by the date and time they happened.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-timestamp-troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshoot your `@timestamp` field

Check the following common issues for possible solutions:

- *Timestamp failure* – If your data has inconsistent date formats, you can set `ignore_failure` to `true` for your date processor. This processes logs with correctly formatted dates and ignores those with issues.
- *Incorrect timezone* – Set your timezone using the `timezone` option on the {ref}/date-processor.html[date processor].
- *Incorrect timestamp format* – Your timestamp can be a Java time pattern or one of the following formats: ISO8601, UNIX, UNIX_MS, or TAI64N. See the {ref}/mapping-date-format.html[mapping date format] for more information on timestamp formats.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-extract-log-level]]
== Extract the `log.level` field

Extracting the `log.level` field lets you filter by severity and focus on critical issues. This section shows you how to extract the `log.level` field from this example log:

[source,log]
----
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.
----

To extract and use the `log.level` field:

. <<logs-stream-log-level-pipeline, Add the `log.level` field to the dissect processor pattern in your ingest pipeline.>>
. <<logs-stream-log-level-simulate, Test the pipeline with the simulate API.>>
. <<logs-stream-log-level-query, Query your logs based on the `log.level` field.>>

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-log-level-pipeline]]
=== Add `log.level` to your ingest pipeline

Add the `%{log.level}` option to the dissect processor pattern in the ingest pipeline you created in the <<logs-stream-ingest-pipeline, Extract the `@timestamp` field>> section:

[source,console]
----
PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default
{
  "description": "Extracts the timestamp from log",
  "processors": [
    {
      "dissect": {
        "field": "message",
        "pattern": "%{@timestamp} %{log.level} %{message}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Now your pipeline will extract these fields:

- The `@timestamp` field – `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z`
- The `log.level` field – `WARN`
- The `message` field – `192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.`

After creating your pipeline, an index template points your log data to your pipeline. You can use the index template you created in the <<logs-stream-index-template, Extract the `@timestamp` field>> section.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-log-level-simulate]]
=== Test the pipeline with the simulate API

Test that your ingest pipeline works as expected with the {ref}/simulate-pipeline-api.html#ingest-verbose-param[simulate pipeline API]:

        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-log-level-query]]
=== Query logs based on `log.level`

Once you've extracted the `log.level` field, you can query for high-severity logs like `WARN` and `ERROR`, which may need immediate attention, and filter out less critical `INFO` and `DEBUG` logs.

Let's say you have the following logs with varying severities:

[source,log]
----
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.

Add them to your data stream using this command:

[source,console]
----
POST logs-example-default/_bulk
{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%." }
{ "create": {} }

{ "create": {} }
{ "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:16.005Z INFO 192.168.1.102 User changed profile picture." }
----

Then, query for documents with a log level of `WARN` or `ERROR` with this command: 

[source,console]
----
GET logs-example-default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "log.level": ["WARN", "ERROR"]

[[logs-stream-extract-host-ip]]
== Extract the `host.ip` field

Extracting the `host.ip` field lets you filter logs by host IP addresses. This way you can focus on specific hosts that you’re having issues with or find disparities between hosts. 

The `host.ip` field is part of the {ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]. Through the ECS, the `host.ip` field is mapped as an {ref}/ip.html[`ip` field type]. `ip` field types allow range queries so you can find logs with IP addresses in a specific range. You can also query `ip` field types using CIDR notation to find logs from a particular network or subnet.

This section shows you how to extract the `host.ip` field from the following example logs and query based on the extracted fields:

[source,log]
----
2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%.

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-host-ip-pipeline]]
=== Add `host.ip` to your ingest pipeline

Add the `%{host.ip}` option to the dissect processor pattern in the ingest pipeline you created in the <<logs-stream-ingest-pipeline, Extract the `@timestamp` field>> section:

[source,console]

----

Your pipeline will extract these fields:

- The `@timestamp` field – `2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z`
- The `log.level` field – `WARN`
- The `host.ip` field – `192.168.1.101`
- The `message` field – `Disk usage exceeds 90%.`

After creating your pipeline, an index template points your log data to your pipeline. You can use the index template you created in the <<logs-stream-index-template, Extract the `@timestamp` field>> section.

[[logs-stream-host-ip-simulate]]
=== Test the pipeline with the simulate API

Test that your ingest pipeline works as expected with the {ref}/simulate-pipeline-api.html#ingest-verbose-param[simulate pipeline API]:

[source,console]
----
POST _ingest/pipeline/logs-example-default/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": {
        "message": "2023-08-08T13:45:12.123Z WARN 192.168.1.101 Disk usage exceeds 90%."
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

The results should show the `@timestamp`, `log.level`, and `host.ip` fields extracted from the `message` field:

=== Query logs based on `host.ip`

You can query your logs based on the `host.ip` field in different ways. The following sections detail querying your logs using CIDR notation and range queries. 

[discrete]
[[logs-stream-ip-cidr]]
==== CIDR notation 

You can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation[CIDR notation] to query your log data using a block of IP addresses that fall within a certain network segment. CIDR notations uses the format of `[IP address]/[prefix length]`. The following command queries IP addresses in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet meaning IP addresses from `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`.

[source,console]
----
GET logs-example-default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "host.ip": "192.168.1.0/24"
    }
  }
}
----

Because all of the example logs are in this range, you'll get the following results:

[[logs-stream-range-query]]
==== Range queries

You can use {ref}/query-dsl-range-query.html[range queries] to query logs in a specific range. 

The following command searches for IP addresses greater than or equal to `192.168.1.100` and less than or equal to `192.168.1.102`.

[source,console]
----
GET logs-example-default/_search

[[logs-stream-ip-ignore-malformed]]
=== Ignore malformed IP addresses

When you're ingesting a large batch of log data, a single malformed IP address can cause the entire batch to fail. You can prevent this by setting `ignore_malformed` to `true` for the `host.ip` field. Update the `host.ip` field to ignore malformed IPs using the {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[update mapping API]:

[source,console]
----
PUT /logs-example-default/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "host.ip": {
      "type": "ip",
      "ignore_malformed": true
    }
  }
