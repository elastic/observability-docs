[[view-monitor-status]]
= View monitor status

The *Monitors* page provides you with a high-level view of all
the services you are monitoring to help you quickly diagnose outages and other connectivity issues
within your network.

To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime > Monitors*.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Each endpoint, URL, and service represents a _monitor_.
=====

[[filter-monitors]]
== Filter monitors

To get started with your analysis, use the automated filter options,
such as location, port, scheme, and tags, or define a custom filter by field, URL,
monitor ID, and other attributes.

[[monitor-availability]]
== Monitor availability

The snapshot panel displays the overall status of the environment you’re monitoring or
a subset of those monitors. You can see the total number of detected monitors within
the selected date range, based on the last check reported by {heartbeat}, along
with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

Next to the counts, a histogram shows a count of *Pings over time* with a breakdown
of `Up` and `Down` counts per time bucket.

Information about individual monitors is displayed in the monitor list and provides
a quick way to navigate to a detailed visualization for hosts or endpoints.

The information displayed includes the recent status of a host or endpoint, when the monitor
was last checked, its URL, and, if applicable, the TLS certificate expiration time. There is
also a sparkline showing downtime history.

[TIP]
=====
Use monitor tags to display a custom assortment of monitors; for example, consider assigning
tags based on a monitor's hosted cloud provider – making it easy to quickly see all monitors
hosted on GCP, AWS, etc.
=====

Expand the table row for a specific monitor on the list to view additional
information such as which alerts are configured for the monitor, a recent error and
when it occurred, the date and time of any recent test runs, and it's URL.

[[observability-integrations]]
== Integrate with Logs, Metrics, and APM

The Monitor list also contains a menu of available integrations. Expand the table
row for a specific monitor on the list, and then click *Investigate*. 

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs,
metrics, or APM data relating to that monitor. You can choose:

* Show host, pod, or container logs in the <<monitor-logs,{logs-app}>>.
* Show APM data in the {kibana-ref}/traces.html[{apm-app}].
* Show host, pod, or container metrics in the <<analyze-metrics,{metrics-app}>>.

[[view-certificate-status]]
== View TLS certificate status

The *TLS Certificates* page lists the TLS certificates that are being monitored and 
shows the TLS certificate data in your indices. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime > TLS Certificates*.

In addition to the common name, associated monitors, issuer information, and SHA fingerprints,
an assigned status is derived from the threshold values in the <<configure-uptime-settings,Settings>> page.

The table entries can be sorted by _status_ and _valid until_. You can use the search bar at the
top of the view to find values in most of the TLS-related fields in your Uptime indices.

Additionally, you can select the *Alerts and rules* dropdown at the top of the page, and create a <<tls-certificate-alert,TLS rule>>.
