[[view-monitor-status]]
= View monitor status

The *Overview* page provides a high-level view of all
the services that you are monitoring to help you quickly diagnose outages and other connectivity issues
within your network.

To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Each endpoint, URL, and service represents a _monitor_.
=====

[[filter-monitors]]
== Filter monitors

To get started with your analysis, use the automated filter options,
such as location, port, scheme, and tags, or define a custom filter by field, URL,
monitor ID, and other attributes.

[[monitor-availability]]
== Monitor availability

The snapshot panel displays the overall status of the environment you’re monitoring or
a subset of those monitors. You can see the total number of detected monitors within
the selected date range, based on the last check reported by {heartbeat}, along
with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

Next to the counts, a histogram shows a count of *Pings over time* with a breakdown
of `Up` and `Down` counts per time bucket.

Information about individual monitors is displayed in the monitor list and provides
a quick way to navigate to a detailed visualization for hosts or endpoints.

The information displayed includes the recent status of a host or endpoint, when the monitor
was last checked, its URL, and, if applicable, the TLS certificate expiration time. There is
also a sparkline showing downtime history.

[TIP]
=====
Use monitor tags to display a custom assortment of monitors; for example, consider assigning
tags based on a monitor's hosted cloud provider – making it easy to quickly see all monitors
hosted on GCP, AWS, etc.
=====

Expand the table row for a specific monitor on the list to view additional
information such as which alerts are configured for the monitor, a recent error and
when it occurred, the date and time of any recent test runs, and it's URL.

[[observability-integrations]]
== Integrate with Logs, Metrics, and APM

The monitor list also contains a menu of available integrations. Expand the table
row for a specific monitor on the list, and then click *Investigate*. 

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs,
metrics, or APM data relating to that monitor. You can choose:

* Show host, pod, or container logs in the <<monitor-logs,{logs-app}>>.
* Show APM data in the {kibana-ref}/traces.html[{apm-app}].
* Show host, pod, or container metrics in the <<analyze-metrics,{metrics-app}>>.

[[view-certificate-status]]
== View TLS certificate status

The *Certificates* page lists the TLS certificates that are being monitored and 
shows the TLS certificate data in your indices.

In addition to the common name, associated monitors, issuer information, and SHA fingerprints,
an assigned status is derived from the threshold values in the <<configure-uptime-settings,Settings>> page.

The table entries can be sorted by _status_ and _valid until_. Use the search bar at the
top of the view to find values in most of the TLS-related fields in your Uptime indices.

Additionally, you can select the *Alerts* dropdown at the top of the page, and create a <<tls-certificate-alert,TLS alert>>.
