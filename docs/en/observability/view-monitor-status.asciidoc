[[view-monitor-status]]
= View monitor status

The *Overview* page provides you with a high-level view of all
the services you are monitoring to help you quickly diagnose outages and other connectivity issues
within your network.

To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Each endpoint, URL, and service represents a _monitor_.

[[filter-monitors]]
== Filter monitors

To get started with your analysis, use the automated filter options,
such as location, port, scheme, and tags, or define a custom filter by field, URL,
monitor ID, and other attributes.

[[monitor-availability]]
== Monitor availability

The snapshot panel displays the overall status of the environment youâ€™re monitoring or
a subset of those monitors. You can see the total number of detected monitors within
the selected date range, based on the last check reported by {heartbeat}, along
with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

Next to the counts, a histogram shows a count of *Pings over time* with a breakdown
of `Up` and `Down` counts per time bucket.

Information about individual monitors is displayed in the monitor list and provides
a quick way to navigate to a detailed visualization for hosts or endpoints.

The information displayed includes the recent status of a host or endpoint, when the monitor
was last checked, its URL, and, if applicable, the TLS certificate expiration time. There is
also a sparkline showing downtime history.

[[view-certificate-status]]
== View TLS certificate status

Click *Certificates status* to view information about certificates that are being monitored.
The *TLS Certificates* page shows the TLS certificate data in your indices.

In addition to the common name, associated monitors, issuer information, and SHA fingerprints,
an assigned status is derived from the threshold values in the <<configure-uptime-settings,Settings>> page.

Several of the columns on this page are sortable. You can use the search bar at the
top of the view to find values in most of the TLS-related fields in your Uptime indices.

Additionally, you can select the *Alerts* dropdown at the top of the page, and create a <<tls-certificate-alert,TLS alert>>.

[[observability-integrations]]
== Integrate with Logs, Metrics, and APM

The Monitor list also contains a menu of available integrations. When Uptime detects
Kubernetes or Docker related host information, it provides links to open the {metrics-app}
or {logs-app} pre-filtered for the host. 

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs,
metrics, or APM data relating to a specific monitor. You can choose:

* Show host, pod, or container logs in the <<monitor-logs,{logs-app}>>.
* Show APM data in the {kibana-ref}/traces.html[{apm-app}].
* Show host, pod, or container metrics in the <<analyze-metrics,{metrics-app}>>.
