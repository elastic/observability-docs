====
*In version `7.x`*, browser checks are in beta and will never be made generally available in `7.x`.

*If you want to use browser checks*, we highly recommend using the latest version of browser checks available in `8.x`. This functionality has changed significantly in version `8.x`. We do _not_ recommend using browser checks in `7.x` anymore.
