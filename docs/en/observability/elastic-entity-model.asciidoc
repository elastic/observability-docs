//TODO: Unhide this topic when we figure out where it should live.

preview::[]

The Elastic Entity Model consists of:

* a data model and related entity indices
* an Entity Discovery Framework, which consists of {ref}/transforms.html[transforms] and {ref}/ingest.html[Ingest pipelines] that read from signal indices and write data to entity indices
* a set of management APIs that empower entity-centric Elastic solution features and workflows

In the context of Elastic Observability,
an _entity_ is an object of interest that can be associated with produced telemetry and identified as unique.
Note that this definition is intentionally closely aligned to the work of the https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/entities/0256-entities-data-model.md#data-model[OpenTelemetry Entities SIG].
Examples of entities include (but are not limited to) services, hosts, and containers.

The concept of an entity is important as a means to unify observability signals based on the underlying entity that the signals describe.

== Enable or disable the Elastic Entity Model

During Technical Preview,
the Elastic Entity Model is enabled when you turn on the entity-centric service inventory described in <<new-experience-services>>.

The following {es} privileges are required to turn on the new experience:

[cols="1,1"]
|====
|**Index privileges**
|names: [`.entities*`], privileges: [`create_index`, `index`, `create_doc`, `auto_configure`, `read`]

names: [`logs-*`, `filebeat*`, `metrics-*`, `metricbeat*`, `traces-*`, `.entities*`], privileges: [`read`, `view_index_metadata`],
|**Cluster privileges**
|`manage_transform`, `manage_ingest_pipelines`, `manage_index_templates`

|**Application privileges**
|application: `kibana-.kibana`, privileges: [`saved_object:entity-definition/*`, `saved_object:entity-discovery-api-key/*`], resources: [*]
|====

For more information, refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] in the {es} documentation.

**To disable the Elastic Entity Model:**

- From the Dev Console, run the command: `DELETE kbn:/internal/entities/managed/enablement`

[NOTE]
====
* The Elastic Entity Model currently supports the <<new-experience-services,new service inventory experience>> limited to service-based entities (as identified by `service.name`) located in data identified by `logs-*` and `trace-*` index patterns
* During Technical Preview, Entity Discovery Framework components are not enabled by default
