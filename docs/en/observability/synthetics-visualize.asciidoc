Synthetic monitoring journeys can be visualized in the {uptime-app} side-by-side with
your other Uptime monitors.

The waterfall chart provides a visualization of every request the page made when
a user executed it. Each line in the chart represents an HTTP network request and
helps you quickly identify what resources are taking the longest to load and what
order they are loading.

The colored bars within each line indicate the time spent per resource. Each color
within a bar represents a different part of that resource's loading process and also
includes the time spent downloading content for specific MIME types: HTML, JS, CSS,
Media, Font, and Other.

It's important to understand each phase of a request so you can improve your site's
speed by reducing the time spent in each one.

.HTTP request phases
====
Queued/Blocked::
The request was initiated but is blocked or queued.

DNS::
The DNS lookup to convert the hostname to an IP Address.

Connecting::
The time it took the request to connect to the server, which could indicate network
issues, connection errors, or an overloaded server.

TLS::
If your page is loading resources securely over TLS, this is the time the browser
spent setting up that connection.

Sending request::
The time spent sending request data to the server.

Waiting (TTFB)::
The time it took the server to generate a response for the request which could
indicate server-side issues.

You can navigate between steps and checks at the top of the page to view the
corresponding waterfall charts.

[[synthetics-alerting]]
== Alerts

User journeys that are tested with synthetic monitoring need to consistently work for your users.
Alerting ensures any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed prior to impacts on your
bottom line or customers' experience.

To receive notifications based on errors and degraded performance,
see <<monitor-status-alert,create a monitor status alert>>.
