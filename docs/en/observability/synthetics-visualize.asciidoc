== Alerts

User journeys that are tested with synthetic monitoring need to consistently work for your users.
Alerting ensures any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed prior to impacts on your
bottom line or customers' experience.

To receive notifications based on errors and degraded performance,
see <<monitor-status-alert,create a monitor status alert>>.
