beta[] Synthetic monitoring journeys can be visualized in the {uptime-app} side-by-side with
your other Uptime monitors.

[[analyze-synthetic-journeys]]
== Analyze synthetic journeys

On the *Monitors* table, you can click a listed journey to analyze it further
on the monitor *Overview* page. You can examine journey details, including its
availability, monitor ID, service availability per monitoring location, the timing
for each synthetic check performed, and check statuses over time.

The *History* table lists the total count of all of the synthetic checks that completed or failed
during the journey. The timestamp for each check is also displayed, along with its duration.
For any failed checks, the error and the failed step are displayed.

[[review-synthetic-checks]]
== Review synthetic checks

To drill down and review the steps performed by a synthetic check, select it in the *History*
table to view the synthetic check details page.

For each synthetic step, the following details are displayed:

* The status of each step: `succeeded`, `failed`, or `skipped`.
* Step name.
* A screenshot taken of the step. In the case of a failed step, the last good screenshot is displayed,
making it easier to compare the step with the previous time it succeeded.

You can expand the table row for each step to view the following additional information:

* An error message in the case of a failed step.
* The script performed for the step.
* The console output listing any errors or warnings from your browser.
* A screenshot taken of the step.
* The stack trace in the case of a failed step to help you quickly debug what caused the error.

Select *View performance breakdown* to view the waterfall chart for the synthetic check.

[[synthetic-waterfall]]
== Waterfall chart

[IMPORTANT]
====
Elastic Synthetics is regularly updated. To view the waterfall chart, make sure you
are running the latest <<synthetics-quickstart-step-one,synthetics docker image>>.
====

The waterfall chart provides a visualization of every request the page made when
a user executed it. Each line in the chart represents an HTTP network request and
helps you quickly identify what resources are taking the longest to load and in what
order they are loading.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/synthetics-waterfall.png[Synthetics waterfall chart]

The colored bars within each line indicate the time spent per resource. Each color
represents a different part of that resource's loading process and
includes the time spent downloading content for specific Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) types: HTML, JS, CSS, Media, Font, XHR, and Other.

It's important to understand each phase of a request so you can improve your site's
speed by reducing the time spent in each one.

// This is collapsed by default
[%collapsible]
.*HTTP request phases*
====
Queued/Blocked::
The request was initiated but is blocked or queued.

DNS::
The DNS lookup to convert the hostname to an IP Address.

Connecting::
The time it took the request to connect to the server. Lengthy connections could indicate
network issues, connection errors, or an overloaded server.

TLS::
If your page is loading resources securely over TLS, this is the time it took to set
up that connection.

Sending request::
The time spent sending the request data to the server.

Waiting (TTFB)::
The time it took for the response generated by the server to be received by the browser. A
lengthy Waiting (TTFB) time could indicate server-side issues.
====

Without leaving the waterfall chart, you can view data points relating to each resource:
resource details, request headers, response headers, and certificate headers. On the
waterfall chart, select a resource name, or any part of each row, to display the
resource details overlay.

For additional analysis, whether to check the content of a CSS file or to view a specific image,
click image:images/url-link-icon.png[View page] located beside each resource,
to view its content in a new tab.

You can also navigate between steps and checks at the top of the page to view the
corresponding waterfall charts.

[[synthetic-filtering]]
=== Filter network requests

To help you quickly identify resources that impact your user experience, you can combine
searching for a network request name with the automated filter options to focus on specific MIME types.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/waterfall-filter.png[Waterfall filter]

You can filter by XHR, HTML, JS, CSS, Font, and Media, to highlight the waterfall chart's matching
results. To remove even more noise from the chart, you can select only the matching requests to view and group.

[[synthetics-alerting]]
== Alerts

User journeys that are tested with synthetic monitoring need to consistently work for your users.
Alerting ensures any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed prior to impacts on your
bottom line or customers' experience.

To receive notifications based on errors and degraded performance,
see <<monitor-status-alert,create a monitor status alert>>.
