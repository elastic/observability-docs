To set up a synthetic monitor, you need to configure the monitor, run it, and send data back to {es}.
After setup is complete, the data will be available in {kib} to view, analyze, and alert on.

[[uptime-set-up-choose]]
There are two ways to set up a synthetic monitor:

* {project-monitors-cap}
* The {synthetics-app}

Read more about each option below, and choose the approach that works best for you.

[[choose-projects]]
= {project-monitors-cap}

With Elastic {project-monitors-cap}, you write tests in an external version-controlled
project using YAML for lightweight monitors and JavaScript or TypeScript for browser monitors.
Then, you use the `@elastic/synthetics` NPM library's `push` command to create
monitors in {kib}.

This approach works well if you want to create both browser monitors and lightweight
monitors. It also allows you to configure and update monitors using a GitOps workflow.

[[choose-ui]]
= {synthetics-app}

The {synthetics-app} is an application in {kib}.
You can create monitors directly in the {synthetics-app} using the user interface.

This approach works well if you want to configure and update monitors using a
UI in your browser.

Get started in <<synthetics-get-started-ui>>.

[NOTE]
====
The Elastic Synthetics integration is a method for creating
synthetic monitors that is no longer recommended.
*Do not use the Elastic Synthetics integration to set up new monitors.*

For details on how to migrate from Elastic Synthetics integration to
{project-monitors} or the {synthetics-app}, refer to <<synthetics-migrate-from-integration>>.

If you've used the Elastic Synthetics integration to create monitors in the past
and need to reference documentation about the integration, go to the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent[8.3 documentation].
