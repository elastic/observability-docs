[[no-kernel-version-check]]
= Override Kernel Version Check 

The configuration option `-no-kernel-version-check` allows for the bypassing of the kernel version check that occurs during the Profiling host agent's startup process. This option takes a boolean argument; setting it to true will enable the bypass, while false is the default value, keeping the kernel version check in place.

By setting this option to true, users can disable the checking of kernel versions for eBPF support. Use this feature at your own risk, especially when running the agent on older kernels with backported eBPF functionalities.

On kernels with unfixed eBPF bugs, this could crash your system.

== Example

The following example shows how to configure the Universal Profiling agent with a threshold of 50 and an interval of 2 minutes and 30 seconds:

[source,bash]
----
sudo pf-host-agent/pf-host-agent -no-kernel-version-check=true ...'
