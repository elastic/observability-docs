[[no-kernel-version-check]]
= Override Kernel Version Check 

The configuration option `-no-kernel-version-check` allows for the bypassing of the kernel version check that occurs during the Profiling host agent's startup process. This option takes a boolean argument; setting it to `true` will enable the bypass, while `false` is the default value, keeping the kernel version check in place.

By setting this option to `true`, users can disable the checking of kernel versions for eBPF support. Use this feature at your own risk, especially when running the agent on older kernels with backported eBPF functionalities.

On kernels with unfixed eBPF bugs, this could crash your system.
