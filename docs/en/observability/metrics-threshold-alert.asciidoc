[[metrics-threshold-alert]]
= Create a metrics threshold alert

Based on the metrics that are listed on the *Metrics Explorer* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold alert to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
time period.

Additionally, each alert can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Metrics*, and then click *Metrics Explorer*.
. On the *Metrics Explorer* page, click *Alerts > Create alert*.

[TIP]
=====
You can create an alert from every graph displayed on the *Metrics Explorer* page. Click *Actions* and 
then select *Create alert*. The condition, filter, and the create per sections of the threshold alert
are automatically populated.

[[metrics-conditions]]
== Metric conditions

Conditions for each alert can be applied to specific metrics that you select. You can select the aggregation type,
the metric, and specify the threshold value to be alerted on. To help you determine which thresholds are meaningful
to you, the preview charts provide a visualization. 

When you select *Alert me if there's no data*, the alert is triggered if the metrics don't report any data over the
expected time period, or if the alert fails to query {es}.

The *Filters* control the scope of the alert, and the *Create alert per* creates an instance of the alert for every
unique value of the `field` added. For example, create an alert per host, or per every mount point of each host. You
can also add multiple fields.

Before creating an alert, you can preview whether the alert would have been triggered in the last hour,
day, week, or month.
