[[metrics-threshold-alert]]
= Create a metrics threshold rule

Based on the metrics that are listed on the *Metrics Explorer* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold rule to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
time period.

Additionally, each rule can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Metrics*.
. On the *Inventory* page or the *Metrics Explorer* page, click *Alerts > Metrics*.
. Select *Create threshold alert*.

[TIP]
=====
When you select *Create threshold alert*, the rule is automatically populated with the same parameters
you've configured on the *Metrics Explorer* page. If you've chosen a *graph per* value, your rule is
pre-configured to monitor and notify about each individual graph displayed on the page.

You can also create a rule based on a single graph. On the *Metrics Explorer* page,
click *Actions > Create alert*. The condition and filter sections of the threshold rule
are automatically populated.

[[metrics-conditions]]
== Metric conditions

Conditions for each rule can be applied to specific metrics that you select. You can select the aggregation type,
the metric, and by including a warning threshold value, you can be alerted on multiple threshold values based on severity scores.
To help you determine which thresholds are meaningful to you, the preview charts provide a visualization.

In this example, the conditions state that you will receive a critical alert for any any hosts that have a CPU usage of 120% or above and a warning alert if CPU usage is 100% or above. Note that you will receive a critical alert only if memory usage is 20% or above, as per the second condition.

When you select *Alert me if there's no data*, the rule is triggered if the metrics don't report any data over the
expected time period, or if the rule fails to query {es}.

The *Filters* control the scope of the rule, and the *Create alert per* creates an instance of the alert for every
unique value of the `field` added. For example, create a rule per host, or per every mount point of each host. You
can also add multiple fields.

Before creating a rule, you can preview whether the rule would have been triggered in the last hour,
day, week, or month.

[[action-types-metrics]]
== Action types

You can extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following supported built-in integrations.

When configuring an action type, you can define precisely when the alert is triggered by selecting a specific
threshold condition: `Alert`, `Warning`, or `Recovered` (a value that was once above a threshold has now dropped below it).

== Action variables

This section details the variables that metrics threshold rules will send to your actions.

[float]
=== Basic variables

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/basic-variables.png[The default metrics threshold rule message detailing basic variables]

The default message for a metrics threshold rule displays the basic variables you can use.

- `context.group`: This variable resolves to the **group** that the rule conditions detected.
For Inventory rules, this is the name of a monitored host, pod, container, and so on. For metric threshold rules,
this is the value of the field specified in the **Create alert per** field or `*` if the rule is configured
to aggregate your entire infrastructure.
- `context.alertState`: Depending on why the action is triggered, this variable resolves to `ALERT`, `NO DATA`,
or `ERROR`. `ALERT` means the rule condition is detected, `NO DATA` means that no data was returned for the
time period that the rule queried, and `ERROR` indicates an error when querying the data.
- `context.reason`: This variable describes why the rule is in its current state. For each of the rule
conditions, it includes the **detected value** of the monitored **metric**, and a description of the **threshold**.
- `context.timestamp`: This variable resolves to the timestamp of when the rule was evaluated.

[float]
=== Advanced variables

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/advanced-variables.png[The default metrics threshold rule message detailing advanced variables]

Instead of using `context.reason` to provide all the information you need, there may be cases when you’d like
to customize your action message. Metrics threshold rules provide advanced context variables that have a tree structure.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
These variables must use the structure of `{{context.[Variable Name].condition[Number]}}`. For example,
`{{context.value.condition0}}`, `{{context.value.condition1}}`, and so on. This is required even if your
rule has only one condition (accessible with `.condition0`). Using just `{{context.[Variable Name]}}` evaluates
to a blank line or `[object Object]` depending on the action type.
==============================================

- `context.value.condition[X]`: This variable resolves to the detected value of conditions 0, 1, 2, and so on.
- `context.value.threshold[X]`: This variable resolves to the threshold values of conditions 0, 1, 2, and so on.
- `context.value.metric[X]`: This variable resolves to the monitored metric of conditions 0, 1, 2, and so on.

[[metrics-alert-settings]]
== Settings

With metrics threshold rules, it's not possible to set an explicit index pattern as part of the configuration. The index pattern is instead inferred from
*Metrics indices* on the <<configure-settings,Settings>> page of the {metrics-app}.

With each execution of the rule check, the *Metrics indices* setting is checked, but it is not stored when the rule is created.

The *Timestamp* field that is set under *Settings* determines which field is used for timestamps in queries.
