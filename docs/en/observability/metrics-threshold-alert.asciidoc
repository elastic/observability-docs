[[metrics-threshold-alert]]
= Create a metrics threshold alert

Based on the metrics that are listed on the *Metrics Explorer* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold alert to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
time period.

Additionally, each alert can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications.

. In the side navigation, expand *Observability*, click *Metrics*, and then click *Metrics Explorer*.
. On the *Metrics Explorer* page, click *Alerts*, and then select *Create alert*.

[[metrics-conditions]]
== Metric conditions

Conditions for each alert can be applied to specific metrics that you select. You can select the aggregation type,
the metric, and specify the threshold value to be alerted on. To help you determine which thresholds are meaningful
to you, the preview charts provide a visualization. You can also select to get alerted when the metric does not
report any data over the expected time period, or if the alert fails to query {es}.

day, week, or month.
