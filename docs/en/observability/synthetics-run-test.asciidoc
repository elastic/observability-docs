// == Run on CI

// You can also run a synthetic project on your CI environment. Elastic's synthetics runner can output results in a few different formats, including JSON and JUnit
// (the standard format supported by most CI platforms).

// If any of your journeys fail, the synthetics agent it will yield a non-zero exit code, which most CI systems pick up as a failure by default.

// You can see an example using GitHub Actions in the
// https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/run-synthetics.yml[elastic/synthetics-demo] repository.
// This example sets up a job that executes the synthetics runner and tells the runner to yield results in a JUnit format.
