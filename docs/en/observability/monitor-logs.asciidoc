The {logs-app} in {kib} enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs
ingested into {es}. Instead of having to log into different servers, change
directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in the {logs-app}.

Using {agent} integrations, you can ingest logs from Kubernetes, MySQL, and many
more data sources. Log events are indexed into {es} and are sorted from older to newer,
with infinite scrolling in both directions.

Logs Explorer allows you to quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
