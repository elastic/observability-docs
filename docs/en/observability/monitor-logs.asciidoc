[[monitor-logs]]
= Explore logs

The {logs-app} in {kib} enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs
ingested into {es}. Instead of having to log into different servers, change
directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in the {logs-app}.

Logs Explorer allows you to quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
Refer to the <<explore-logs>> documentation for more on using Logs Explorer.

The {logs-app} also provides:

* live <<tail-logs,streaming of logs>>, filtering using auto-complete, and a logs histogram for quick navigation.
* {ml} to detect specific <<inspect-log-anomalies,log anomalies>> automatically and <<categorize-logs, categorize log messages>> to quickly identify patterns in your
log events.

To view the {logs-app}, go to *{observability} > Logs*.
