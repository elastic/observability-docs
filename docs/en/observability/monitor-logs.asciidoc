[[monitor-logs]]
= Log monitoring

The {logs-app} in {kib} enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs
ingested into {es}. Instead of having to log into different servers, change
directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in the {logs-app}. 

Using {filebeat} {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[modules], you can ingest
logs from Kubernetes, MySQL, and many more data sources. Log events are indexed
into {es} and are sorted from older to newer, with infinite scrolling in both directions.

There is live streaming of logs, filtering using auto-complete, and a logs histogram
for quick navigation. You can also use machine learning to detect specific log
anomalies automatically and categorize log messages to quickly identify patterns in your
log events.

To view the {logs-app}, go to *Observability > Logs*.
