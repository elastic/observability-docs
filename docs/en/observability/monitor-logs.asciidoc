[[monitor-logs]]
= Monitor logs

The {logs-app} in {kib} enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs
ingested into {es}. Instead of having to log into different servers, changing
directories and tailing individual files, all the logs are available in the {logs-app}. 

Using {filebeat} {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[modules], you can ingest
logs from Kubernetes, MySQL, and many more data sources. Log events are indexed
into {es} and are sorted from older to newer, with infinite scrolling in both directions.

There is live streaming of logs, filtering using auto-complete, and a logs histogram
for quick navigation. You can also use machine learning to detect specific log
anomalies automatically and categorize log messages to quickly identify patterns in your
log events.
