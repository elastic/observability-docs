https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/[Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)] is a message
queuing service that allows your application components to communicate
asynchronously through messages, making it easier to decouple and scale
microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

AWS SQS and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated and therefore, you can collect,
view, and analyze data. Metrics for Amazon SQS queues are automatically
collected and pushed to CloudWatch at one-minute intervals.

You can view and analyze the queueâ€™s metrics from the Amazon SQS console, the
CloudWatch console, the AWS CLI, or by using the CloudWatch API.

The Elastic {integrations-docs}/aws/sqs[Amazon SQS integration]
collects metrics from Amazon CloudWatch using {agent}.

== Get started

To collect SQS metrics, you typically need to install the Elastic
{integrations-docs}/aws/sqs[Amazon SQS integration] and deploy an {agent}
locally or on an EC2 instance.

Expand the **quick guide** to learn how, or skip to the next section if your
data is already in {es}.

//Sets the integration name used in the quick guide
:integration-name: Amazon SQS

include::{observability-docs-root}/docs/en/shared/integrations-quick-guide.asciidoc[]

//Clears the integration name
:integration-name!:

{agent} is currently the preferred way to add SQS metrics. For other ways, refer
to {cloud}/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html[Adding data to {es}].
