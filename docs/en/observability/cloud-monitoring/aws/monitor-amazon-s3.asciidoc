https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)]
is a highly available object storage service that provides durability, security,
and scalability. To store data, you create one or more buckets that contain
objects. An object consists of a file and optional metadata that describes the
file. For each bucket, you can control access to it.

Like most AWS services, Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so you
can collect, view, and analyze CloudWatch metrics for your S3 buckets to help
understand and improve the performance of applications that use Amazon S3.
The Elastic {integrations-docs}/aws/s3[Amazon S3 integration] collects metrics
from Amazon CloudWatch using {agent}.

With the Amazon S3 integration, you can collect these S3 metrics from
CloudWatch:

* Daily storage metrics for buckets. Use these metrics to monitor bucket
storage. These metrics are reported once per day by default and are provided to
AWS customers at no additional cost.
* Request metrics. Use these metrics to quickly identify and act on
operational issues. These request metrics are available at one-minute intervals
after some latency for processing, and they are not enabled by default.

== Get started

If you plan to collect request metrics, enable them for the S3 buckets you want
to monitor. To learn how, refer to the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html[AWS documentation].

To collect S3 metrics, you typically need to install the Elastic
{integrations-docs}/aws/s3[Amazon S3 integration] and deploy an {agent}
locally or on an EC2 instance.

Expand the **quick guide** to learn how, or skip to the next section if your
data is already in {es}.

//Sets the integration name used in the quick guide
:integration-name: Amazon S3

{agent} is currently the preferred way to add S3 metrics. For other
ways, refer to {cloud}/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html[Adding data to {es}].

For example, to see an overview of your S3 metrics in {kib}, go to
the **Dashboard** app and navigate to the **[Metrics AWS] S3 Overview**
dashboard.
