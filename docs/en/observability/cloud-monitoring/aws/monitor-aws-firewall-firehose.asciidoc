In this section, you'll learn how to send AWS Network Firewall log events from AWS to your Elastic stack using Amazon Data Firehose.

You will go through the following steps:

- Select a AWS Network Firewall-compatible resource 
- Create a delivery stream in Amazon Data Firehose
- Set up logging to forward the logs to the Elastic stack using a Firehose stream
- Visualize your logs in {kib}

== Before you begin

We assume that you already have:

- An AWS account with permissions to pull the necessary data from AWS.
- A deployment using our hosted {ess} on {ess-trial}[{ecloud}]. The deployment includes an {es} cluster for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing your data. AWS Data Firehose works with Elastic Stack version 7.17 or greater, running on Elastic Cloud only.

IMPORTANT: AWS PrivateLink is not supported. Make sure the deployment is on AWS, because the Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream connects specifically to an endpoint that needs to be on AWS.

== Step 1: Install AWS integration in {kib}

. In {kib}, navigate to *Management* > *Integrations* and browse the catalog to find the AWS integration.

. Navigate to the *Settings* tab and click *Install AWS assets*.

== Step 2: Select a resource

You can either use an existing AWS Network Firewall, or create a new one for testing purposes.

Creating a Network Firewall is not trivial and is beyond the scope of this guide. For more information, check the AWS documentation on the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html[Getting started with AWS Network Firewall] guide.

== Step 3: Create a stream in Amazon Data Firehose

. Go to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/[AWS console] and navigate to Amazon Data Firehose.  

. Click *Create Firehose stream* and choose the source and destination of your Firehose stream. Set source to `Direct PUT` and destination to `Elastic`. 

. Collect {es} endpoint and API key from your deployment on Elastic Cloud.
+
- Elastic endpoint URL: Enter the Elasticsearch endpoint URL of your Elasticsearch cluster. To find the Elasticsearch endpoint, go to the Elastic Cloud console and select *Connection details*.
+
- API key: Enter the encoded Elastic API key. To create an API key, go to the Elastic Cloud console, select *Connection details* and click *Create and manage API keys*. If you are using an API key with *Restrict privileges*, make sure to review the Indices privileges to provide at least "auto_configure" and "write" permissions for the indices you will be using with this delivery stream.

. Set up the delivery stream by specifying the following data:
+
- Elastic endpoint URL
- API key
- Content encoding: gzip
- Retry duration: 60 (default) 
- Parameter *es_datastream_name* = `logs-aws.firewall_logs-default`
- Backup settings: failed data only to s3 bucket

The Firehose stream is ready to send logs to our Elastic Cloud deployment.

== Step 4: Enable logging

The AWS Network Firewall logs have built-in logging support. It can send logs to Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

To enable logging to Amazon Data Firehose:

. In the AWS console, navigate to the AWS Network Firewall service.

. Select the firewall for which you want to enable logging.

. In the *Logging* section, click *Edit*.

. Select the *Send logs to* option and choose *Kinesis Data Firehose*.

. Select the Firehose stream you created in the previous step.

. Click *Save*.

At this point, the Network Firewall will start sending logs to the Firehose stream.

== Step 5: Visualize your Network Firewall logs in {kib}

With the new logging settings in place, the Network Firewall starts sending log events to the Firehose stream.

Navigate to {kib} and choose *Visualize your logs with Discover*.
