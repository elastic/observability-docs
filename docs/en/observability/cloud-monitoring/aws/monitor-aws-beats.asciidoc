[[aws-before-you-begin]]
=== Before you begin

Create a deployment using our hosted {ess} on {ess-trial}[{ecloud}].
The deployment includes an {es} cluster for storing and searching your data,
and {kib} for visualizing and managing your data.

With this tutorial, we assume that your logs and your infrastructure
data are already shipped to CloudWatch. We are going to show you how you can
stream your data from CloudWatch to {es}. If you don’t know how to put
your {aws} logs and infrastructure data in CloudWatch, Amazon provides a lot of
documentation around this specific topic:

* Collect your logs and infrastructure data from specific https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAnIhIwE5hY[{aws} services]
* Export your logs https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/S3ExportTasksConsole.html[to an S3 bucket]


[discrete]
[[aws-step-one]]
=== Step 1:  Create an S3 Bucket

To centralize your logs in {es}, you need to have an S3 bucket.
{filebeat}, the agent you'll use to collect logs, has an input for S3.

In the https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3[{aws} S3 console], click on *Create
bucket*. Give the bucket a *name* and specify the *region* in which you want it
deployed.

[discrete]
[[aws-step-two]]
=== Step 2:  Create an SQS Queue

You should now have an S3 bucket in which you can export your logs, but you will
also need an SQS queue. To avoid significant lagging with polling all
log files from each S3 bucket, we will use Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS).
This will provide us with an Amazon S3 notification when a new S3 object is
created. The {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-input-aws-s3.html[{filebeat} S3 input]
checks SQS for new messages regarding the new object created in S3 and uses the
information in these messages to retrieve logs from S3 buckets. With this setup,
periodic polling from each S3 bucket is not needed. Instead, the {filebeat} S3
input guarantees near real-time data collection from S3 buckets with both speed
and reliability.

Create an SQS queue and configure our S3 bucket to send a message to the SQS
queue whenever new logs are present in the S3 bucket. Go to the https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/[SQS console]

[NOTE]
=====
Make sure that the queue is created in the same region as the S3 bucket.
=====
image::creating-a-queue.png[Queue Creation]

Create a standard SQS queue and edit the access policy by using a JSON object to
define an advanced access policy:

[NOTE]
=====
Replace `<sqs-arn>` with the ARN of the SQS queue, `<s3-bucket-arn>` with the
ARN of the S3 bucket you just created, the `<source-account>` with your source
account.
=====

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

[discrete]
[[aws-step-three]]
=== Step 3:  Enable Event Notification

Now that your queue is created, go to the properties of the S3 bucket you
created and click *Create event notification*.

Specify that you want to send a notification on every object creation event.

image::configure-event-notification.png[Event Notification Setting]

Set the destination as the SQS queue you just created.

image::configure-notification-output.png[Event Notification Setting]

[discrete]
[[aws-step-four]]
=== Step 4: Install and configure {filebeat}

To monitor {aws} using the {stack}, you need two main components:
an Elastic deployment to store and analyze the data and an agent to collect and
ship the data.

:leveloffset: -3

[discrete]
[[aws-step-five]]
=== Step 5: Configure the {aws} Module

Now that the output is working, you can set up the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-aws.html[{filebeat} {aws}] module which
will automatically create the {aws} input. This
module checks SQS for new messages regarding the new object created in the S3
bucket and uses the information in these messages to retrieve logs from S3
buckets. With this setup, periodic polling from each S3 bucket is not needed.

There are many different filesets available: `cloudtrail`, `vpcflow`, `ec2`,
`cloudwatch`, `elb` and `s3access`. In this tutorial, we are going to show you a
few examples using the `ec2` and the `s3access` filesets.

The `ec2` fileset is
used to ship and process logs stored in CloudWatch, and export them to an S3
bucket. The `s3access` fileset is used when S3 access logs need to be collected.
It provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server
access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log
information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you
learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill.

Let's enable the {aws} module in {filebeat}.

[source,bash]
----
./filebeat modules enable aws
----

Edit the `modules.d/aws.yml` file with the following configurations.

[source,yml]
----
- module: aws
  cloudtrail:
    enabled: false
  cloudwatch:
    enabled: false
  ec2:
    enabled: true <1>
    var.credential_profile_name: fb-aws <2>
    var.queue_url: https://sqs.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/836370109380/howtoguide-tutorial <3>
  elb:
    enabled: false
  s3access:
    enabled: false
  vpcflow:
    enabled: false
----
<1> Enables the `ec2` fileset.
<2> This is the AWS profile defined following the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html[AWS standard].
<3> Add the URL to the queue containing notifications around the bucket containing the EC2 logs

Make sure that the {aws} user used to collect the logs from S3 has at least the
following permissions attached to it:

[source,yml]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
              "s3:GetObject",
              "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
              "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility",
              "sqs:DeleteMessage"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----

You can now upload your logs to the S3 bucket. If you are using CloudWatch,
make sure to edit the policy of your bucket as shown in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/S3ExportTasksConsole.html[step 3 of the {aws} user guide].
This will help you avoid permissions issues.

Start {filebeat} to collect the logs.

[source,bash]
----
./filebeat -e
----

Here's what we've achieved so far:

image::one-bucket-archi.png[Current Architecture]

Now, let's configure the `s3access` fileset.
The goal here is to be able to monitor how people access the bucket we
created. To do this, we'll create another bucket and another queue.
The new architecture will look like this:

image::two-buckets-archi.png[Architecture with Access Logging Enabled]

Create a new S3 bucket and SQS queue. Ensure that the event notifications on the new bucket are enabled,
and that it's sending notifications to the new queue.

Now go back to the first bucket, and go to *Properties* > *Server access
logging*. Specify that you want to ship the access logs to the bucket you most recently
created.

image::Server-Access-Logging.png[Enabling Server Access Logging]

Copy the URL of the queue you created. Edit the `modules.d/aws.yml`file with
the following configurations.

[source,yml]
----
- module: aws
  cloudtrail:
    enabled: false
  cloudwatch:
    enabled: false
  ec2:
    enabled: true <1>
    var.credential_profile_name: fb-aws <2>
    var.queue_url: https://sqs.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/836370109380/howtoguide-tutorial <3>
  elb:
    enabled: false
  s3access:
    enabled: true <1>
    var.credential_profile_name: fb-aws <2>
    var.queue_url: https://sqs.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/836370109380/access-log <4>
  vpcflow:
    enabled: false
----
<1> Enables the `ec2` fileset.
<2> This is the AWS profile defined following the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html[AWS standard].
<3> Add the URL to the queue containing notifications around the bucket containing the EC2 logs
<4> Add the URL to the queue containing notifications around the bucket containing the S3 access logs

Once you have edited the config file, you need to restart {filebeat}. To stop
{filebeat}, you can press CTRL + C in the terminal. Now let's restart {filebeat} by
running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./filebeat -e
----

[[aws-step-six]]
=== Step 6: Visualize Logs

Now that the logs are being shipped to {es} we can visualize them in
{kib}. To see the raw logs, open the main menu in {kib}, then click
**Logs**:

image::EC2-logs.png[EC2 logs in the Logs UI]

// lint ignore filebeat
The filesets we used in the previous steps also come with pre-built dashboards
that you can use to visualize the data. In {kib}, open the main menu and click
**Dashboard**. Search for S3 and select the dashboard called:
**[Filebeat AWS] S3 Server Access Log Overview**:

image::S3-Server-Access-Logs.png[S3 Server Access Log Overview]

This gives you an overview of how your S3 buckets are being accessed.

[discrete]
[[aws-step-seven]]
=== Step 7: Collect Infrastructure metrics

To monitor your {aws} infrastructure you will need to first make sure your
infrastructure data are being shipped to CloudWatch. To ship the data to
{es} we are going to use the {aws} module from {metricbeat}. This module
periodically fetches monitoring metrics from AWS CloudWatch using
**GetMetricData** API for {aws} services.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Extra AWS charges on CloudWatch API requests will be generated by this module.
Please see {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-aws.html#aws-api-requests[AWS API requests] for more details.

[discrete]
[[aws-step-eight]]
=== Step 8: Install and configure {metricbeat}

In a new terminal window, run the following commands.

:leveloffset: +3
include::{observability-docs-root}/docs/en/shared/install-configure-metricbeat.asciidoc[]
:leveloffset: -3

Now that the output is working, you are going to set up the {aws} module.

[discrete]
[[aws-step-nine]]
=== Step 9: Configure the {aws} module

To collect metrics from your {aws} infrastructure, we'll use the
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-aws.html[{metricbeat} {aws}] module. This module
contains many metricsets: `billing`, `cloudwatch`, `dynamodb`, `ebs`,
`ec2`, `elb`, `lambda`, and many more. Each metricset is created to help you
stream and process your data. In this tutorial, we're going to show you a
few examples using the `ec2` and the `billing` metricsets.

. Let's enable the {aws} module in {metricbeat}.
+
[source,bash]
----
./metricbeat modules enable aws
----

. Edit the `modules.d/aws.yml` file with the following configurations.
+
[source,yml]
----
- module: aws <1>
  period: 24h <2>
  metricsets:
    - billing <3>
  credential_profile_name: mb-aws <4>
  cost_explorer_config:
    group_by_dimension_keys:
      - "AZ"
      - "INSTANCE_TYPE"
      - "SERVICE"
    group_by_tag_keys:
      - "aws:createdBy"
- module: aws <1>
  period: 300s <2>
  metricsets:
    - ec2 <3>
  credential_profile_name: mb-aws <4>
----
+
<1> Defines the module that is going to be used.
<2> Defines the period at which the metrics are going to be collected
<3> Defines the metricset that is going to be used.
<4> This is the AWS profile defined following the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html[AWS standard].

Make sure that the {aws} user used to collect the metrics from CloudWatch has at
least the following permissions attached to it:

[source,yml]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                "iam:ListAccountAliases",
                "tag:getResources",
                "ce:GetCostAndUsage"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----

You can now start {metricbeat}:

[source,bash]
----
./metricbeat -e
----

[discrete]
[[aws-step-ten]]
=== Step 10: Visualize metrics

Now that the metrics are being streamed to {es} we can visualize them in
{kib}. In {kib}, open the main menu and click
**Infrastructure**. Make sure to show the **{aws}** source and the **EC2 Instances**:

image::EC2-instances.png[Your EC2 Infrastructure]

// lint ignore metricbeat
The metricsets we used in the previous steps also comes with pre-built dashboard
that you can use to visualize the data. In {kib}, open the main menu and click
**Dashboard**. Search for EC2 and select the dashboard called: **[Metricbeat
AWS] EC2 Overview**:

image::ec2-dashboard.png[EC2 Overview]

// lint ignore metricbeat
If you want to track your billings on {aws}, you can also check the
**[Metricbeat AWS] Billing Overview** dashboard:

image::aws-billing.png[Billing Overview]
