https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams]
is a real-time data streaming service that you can use to capture, process, and
store large amounts of data from a variety of sources, including websites,
mobile applications, IoT devices, and more.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so that you can
collect and monitor CloudWatch metrics for your Kinesis data streams, such as
tracking shard usage and recording related operations for each Kinesis data
stream. The Elastic
{integrations-docs}/aws/kinesis[Amazon Kinesis Data Stream integration] collects
metrics from Amazon CloudWatch using {agent}.

By default, Kinesis Data Streams sends stream-level (basic level) metrics to
CloudWatch every minute automatically. There is also shard-level data (enhanced
level) that is sent to CloudWatch every minute and incurs an additional cost per
stream. To get shard-level data, you must specifically enable it for each
stream by using the AWS Kinesis `enable-enhanced-monitoring` API. For example

[source,shell]
----
aws kinesis enable-enhanced-monitoring --stream-name samplestream --shard-level-metrics ALL
----

For more details, refer to the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_EnableEnhancedMonitoring.html[EnableEnhancedMonitoring]
documentation.

[[get-started-kinesis]]
== Get started

To collect Kinesis data stream metrics from Amazon CloudWatch, you typically
need to install the Elastic
{integrations-docs}/aws/kinesis[Amazon Kinesis Data Stream integration] and
deploy an {agent}.

Expand the **quick guide** to learn how, or skip to the next section if your
data is already in {es}.

//Set the integration name used in the quick guide
:integration-name: Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

include::{observability-docs-root}/docs/en/shared/integrations-quick-guide.asciidoc[]

//Clear the integration name
:integration-name!:

{agent} is currently the preferred way to add Kinesis data stream metrics. For
other ways, refer to {cloud}/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html[Adding data to {es}].

For example, to see an overview of your Kinesis data streams in {kib}, go to
the **Dashboard** app and navigate to the **[Metrics AWS] Kinesis Overview**
dashboard.
