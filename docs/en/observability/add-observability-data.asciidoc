[[add-observability-data]]
= Send data to {es}

Elastic provides two main ways to send data to {es}:

* *{agent}*, a single agent for logs, metrics, uptime, security data, and threat
prevention.

* *Legacy {beats}*, lightweight data shippers that send operational data to
{es}. Elastic provides separate {beats} for different types of data, such as
logs, metrics, and uptime.

The method you use depends on your use case, which features you need, and
whether you want to centrally manage your agents. Not sure whether to use
{beats} or {agent}? Refer to {fleet-guide}/beats-agent-comparison.html[{beats}
and {agent} capabilities].
