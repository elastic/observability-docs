= Get started

To use the Elastic Observability, you need {ess} for storing and searching your 
data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing it.

To get started quickly, you can spin up a deployment of our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}]. The deployment includes
{es}, {kib}, and APM Server, and is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. {ess-trial}[Try it out for free].

Or, you can install and self manage {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] 
and {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[Kibana]. First see the 
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about 
supported operating systems and product compatibility. We recommend you use the same 
version of Elasticsearch, Kibana, and APM Server.
