++++

Within the {uptime-app}, create an *Uptime duration anomaly* rule to receive notifications
based on the response durations for all of the geographic locations of each monitor. When a
monitor runs for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and
highlighted on the <<inspect-uptime-duration-anomalies,Monitor duration>> chart.

// lint ignore anomaly-detection
. To access this page, go to **{observability}** -> **Uptime**.
. On the *Monitors* page, select on a monitor, and then click **Enable anomaly detection**.

[[duration-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

For each rule, you can configure which severity level triggers the alert. The default level is `critical`.

The _anomaly score_ is a value from `0` to `100`, which indicates the significance of the anomaly
compared to previously seen anomalies. The highly anomalous values are shown in
red and the low scored values are indicated in blue.

|===

| *warning* | Score `0` and above.

| *minor* | Score `25` and above.

| *major* | Score `50` and above.

| *critical* | Score `75` and above.

[[action-types-duration]]
== Action types

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are {kib} services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.

include::../shared/alerting-connectors.asciidoc[]

After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a summary of alerts on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts every twelve hours:

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency such that you choose how often the action runs (for example, at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a custom action interval). In this case, you must also select the specific threshold condition that affects when actions run: `Uptime Duration Anomaly` or `Recovered`.

[[action-variables-duration]]
== Action variables

Use the default notification message or customize it.
You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box
and selecting from a list of available variables.

== Alert recovery

To receive a notification when the alert recovers, select *Run when Recovered*. Use the default notification message or customize it. You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.
