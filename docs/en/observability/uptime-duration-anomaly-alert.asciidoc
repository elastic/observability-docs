[[duration-anomaly-alert]]
= Create an uptime duration anomaly alert

Within the {uptime-app}, create an *Uptime duration anomaly* alert to receive notifications
based on the response durations for all of the geographic locations of each monitor. When a
monitor runs for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and
highlighted on the <<inspect-uptime-duration-anomalies,Monitor duration>> chart.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.
. On the *Overview* page, select on a monitor, and then click *Enable anomaly detection*.



[[duration-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

For each alert, you can configure which severity level triggers the alert. The default level is `critical`.

The _anomaly score_ is a value from `0` to `100`, which indicates the significance of the anomaly
compared to previously seen anomalies. The highly anomalous values are shown in
red and the low scored values are indicated in blue.

|=== 

| *warning* | Score `0` and above.

| *minor* | Score `25` and above.

| *major* | Score `50` and above.

| *critical* | Score `75` and above.
