[[duration-anomaly-alert]]
= Create an uptime duration anomaly rule

Within the {uptime-app}, create an *Uptime duration anomaly* rule to receive notifications
based on the response durations for all of the geographic locations of each monitor. When a
monitor runs for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and
highlighted on the <<inspect-uptime-duration-anomalies,Monitor duration>> chart.

// lint ignore anomaly-detection
. To access this page, go to *{observability} > Uptime*.
. On the *Monitors* page, select on a monitor, and then click *Enable anomaly detection*.

[[duration-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

For each rule, you can configure which severity level triggers the alert. The default level is `critical`.

The _anomaly score_ is a value from `0` to `100`, which indicates the significance of the anomaly
compared to previously seen anomalies. The highly anomalous values are shown in
red and the low scored values are indicated in blue.

|=== 

| *warning* | Score `0` and above.

| *minor* | Score `25` and above.

| *major* | Score `50` and above.

| *critical* | Score `75` and above.

[[action-types-duration]]
== Action types

You can extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are {kib} services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.
