[[configure-uptime-settings]]
= Configure settings

The *Settings* page enables you to change which {heartbeat} indices are displayed
by the {uptime-app}, configure alert connectors, and set expiration/age thresholds
for TLS certificates.

Uptime settings apply to the current space only. To segment
different uptime use cases and domains, use different settings in other spaces.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.
. Click *Settings*.

[[configure-uptime-indices]]
== Configure indices

[NOTE]
=====
The pattern set here only restricts what the {uptime-app} displays. You can still query {es} for
data outside of this pattern.
=====

If your organization has one team for internal IT services, and another
for public services, with each group operating independently, you may want separate {heartbeat} instances per team.

For example, you could create an `it-heartbeat-\*` index pattern and an `external-heartbeat-\*` index pattern.
For each index pattern, you can then create separate roles and users in {es}, each with access to their own spaces,
name them `it` and `external` respectively. For each space, you would set the correct index pattern to match only
the indices that space is allowed to access.

[[configure-uptime-alert-connectors]]
== Configure alert connectors

Alert connectors can be created by clicking the *Create connector* button, which will guide you through selecting the type of
connector and configuring its properties. Once you create a connector it is made available to you anytime you set
up an alert action in the current space.

For more information about each connector, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[action types and connectors].

[[configure-cert-thresholds]]
== Configure certificate thresholds

You can modify certificate thresholds to control how Uptime visualizes your TLS values in
the <<view-certificate-status,Certificates>> page. These settings also determine which certificates are
selected by any TLS alert you create.

|=== 

| *Expiration threshold* | The `expiration` threshold specifies when you are notified
about certificates that are approaching expiration dates. When the value of a certificate's remaining valid days falls
below the `Expiration threshold`, it's considered a warning state. When you define a 
<<tls-certificate-alert,TLS alert>>, you receive a notification about the certificate.

| *Age limit* | The `age` threshold specifies when you are notified about certificates
that have been valid for too long.

|=== 

A standard security requirement is to make sure that your TLS certificates have not been
valid for longer than a year. To help you keep track of which certificates you may want to refresh, 
modify the *Age limit* value to `365` days.
