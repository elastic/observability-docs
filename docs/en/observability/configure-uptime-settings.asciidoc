[[configure-uptime-settings]]
= Configure settings

The *Settings* page enables you to change which {heartbeat} indices are displayed
by the {uptime-app}, configure alert connectors, and set expiration/age thresholds
for TLS certificates.

Uptime settings apply to the current space only. To segment
different uptime use cases and domains, use different settings in other spaces.

. In the side navigation, expand *Observability*, and then click *Metrics*.
. Click *Settings*.

[NOTE]
=====
The pattern set here only restricts what the {uptime-app} displays. You can still query {es} for
data outside of this pattern.
=====

If your organization has one team for internal IT services, and another
for public services, with each group operating independently, you may want separate {heartbeat} instances per team.

For example, you could create an `it-heartbeat-\*` index pattern and an `external-heartbeat-\*` index pattern.
For each index pattern, you can then create separate roles and users in {es}, each with access to their own spaces,
name them `it` and `external` respectively. For each space, you would set the correct index pattern to match only
the indices that space is allowed to access.

[[configure-cert-thresholds]]
== Configure certificate thresholds

You can modify settings in this section to control how Uptime will visualize your TLS values in
the <<view-certificate-status,Certificates>> page. These settings also determine which certificates are
selected by any TLS alert you define.

|=== 

| *Expiration threshold* | The `expiration` threshold specifies when you are notified
about certificates that are approaching expiration dates. When the value of a certificate's remaining valid days falls
below the `Expiration threshold`, it's considered a warning state. When you define a 
<<tls-certificate-alert,TLS alert>>, you receive a notification about the certificate.

| *Age limit* | The `age` threshold specifies when you are notified about certificates
that have been valid for too long.

|=== 

A standard security requirement is to make sure that your TLS certificates have not been
valid for longer than one year. To help you keep track of which certificates you may want to refresh, 
modify the *Age limit* value to `365` days.
