[[configure-uptime-settings]]
= Configure settings

The *Settings* page enables you to change which {heartbeat} indices are displayed
by the {uptime-app}, configure alert connectors, and set expiration/age thresholds
for TLS certificates.

Uptime settings apply to the current space only. To segment
different uptime use cases and domains, use different settings in other spaces.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Uptime*.
. Click *Settings*.

To modify items on this page, you must have the {kibana-ref}/space-rbac-tutorial.html[`all`]
privilege granted to your role. The `all` privilege grants cluster administration operations, like snapshotting,
node shutdown/restart, settings update, rerouting, or managing users and roles.

[[configure-uptime-indices]]
== Configure indices

Specify a comma-separated list of index patterns to match indices in {es} that contain {heartbeat} data.

[NOTE]
=====
The pattern set here only restricts what the {uptime-app} displays. You can still query {es} for
data outside of this pattern.

[[configure-uptime-alert-connectors]]
== Configure alert connectors

*Alerts* work by running checks on a schedule to detect conditions. When a condition is met, the alert tracks
it as an *alert instance* and responds by triggering one or more *actions*. 
Actions typically involve interaction with {kib} services or third party integrations. *Connectors* allow actions
to talk to these services and integrations.

Click *Create connector* and follow the prompts to select a connector type and configure its properties.
After you create a connector, it's available to you anytime you set up an alert action in the current space.

For more information about each connector, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[action types and connectors].

[[configure-cert-thresholds]]
== Configure certificate thresholds

You can modify certificate thresholds to control how Uptime displays your TLS values in
the <<view-certificate-status,Certificates>> page. These settings also determine which certificates are
selected by any TLS alert you create.

|=== 

| *Expiration threshold* | The `expiration` threshold specifies when you are notified
about certificates that are approaching expiration dates. When the value of a certificate's remaining valid days falls
below the `Expiration threshold`, it's considered a warning state. When you define a 
<<tls-certificate-alert,TLS alert>>, you receive a notification about the certificate.

| *Age limit* | The `age` threshold specifies when you are notified about certificates
that have been valid for too long.

|=== 

A standard security requirement is to make sure that your TLS certificates have not been
valid for longer than a year. To help you keep track of which certificates you may want to refresh, 
modify the *Age limit* value to `365` days.
