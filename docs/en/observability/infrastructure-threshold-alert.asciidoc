[[infrastructure-threshold-alert]]
= Create an infrastructure threshold alert

Based on the resources that are listed on the *Inventory* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold alert to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
resource or for a group of resources within your infrastructure.

Additionally, each alert can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications and reduce false positives.

[[inventory-conditions]]
== Inventory conditions

Conditions for each alert can be applied to specific metrics relating to the inventory type you select. For example, 
when you select Docker containers you can add conditions for the CPU usage, memory usage,
inbound traffic, and the outbound traffic metrics. You can also select to get alerted when the metric does not
report any data over the expected time period, or if the alert fails to query {es}.

In this example Kubernetes Pods is the selected inventory type. The conditions state that if the memory usage is
above 95% for any of the pods within the `ingress-nginx` namespace, an alert is triggered.

Before creating an alert, you can preview whether the alert would have been triggered in the last hour,
day, week, or month.
