[[infrastructure-threshold-alert]]
= Create an infrastructure threshold rule

Based on the resources listed on the *Inventory* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold rule to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
resource or a group of resources within your infrastructure.

Additionally, each rule can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications and reduce false positives.

. To access this page, go to *{observability} > Metrics*.
. On the *Inventory* page or the *Metrics Explorer* page, click *Alerts > Infrastructure*.
. Select *Create inventory alert*.

[TIP]
==============================================
When you select *Create inventory alert*, the parameters you configured on the *Inventory* page will automatically
populate the rule. You can use the Inventory first to view which nodes in your infrastructure you'd
like to be notified about and then quickly create a rule in just a few clicks.
==============================================

[[inventory-conditions]]
== Inventory conditions

Conditions for each rule can be applied to specific metrics relating to the inventory type you select.
You can choose the aggregation type, the metric, and by including a warning threshold value, you can be
alerted on multiple threshold values based on severity scores. When creating the rule, you can still get
notified if no data is returned for the specific metric or if the rule fails to query {es}.

In this example, Kubernetes Pods is the selected inventory type. The conditions state that you will receive
a critical alert for any pods within the `ingress-nginx` namespace with a memory usage of 95% or above
and a warning alert if memory usage is 90% or above.

Before creating a rule, you can preview whether the conditions would have triggered the alert in the last
hour, day, week, or month.

[[action-types-infrastructure]]
== Action types

You can extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following supported built-in integrations.

When configuring an action type, you can define precisely when the alert is triggered by selecting a specific
threshold condition: `Alert`, `Warning`, or `Recovered` (a value that was once above a threshold has now dropped below it).

== Action variables

Use the default notification message or customize it.
You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box
and selecting from a list of available variables.

[[infra-alert-settings]]
== Settings

With infrastructure threshold rules, it's not possible to set an explicit index pattern as part of the configuration. The index pattern
is instead inferred from *Metrics indices* on the <<configure-settings,Settings>> page of the {metrics-app}.

With each execution of the rule check, the *Metrics indices* setting is checked, but it is not stored when the rule is created.

The *Timestamp* field that is set under *Settings* determines which field is used for timestamps in queries.
