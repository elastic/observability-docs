[[infrastructure-threshold-alert]]
= Create an infrastructure threshold alert

Based on the resources that are listed on the *Inventory* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold alert to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
resource or for a group of resources within your infrastructure.

Additionally, each alert can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications and reduce false positives.

. In the side navigation, expand *Observability*, and then click *Metrics*.
. On the *Inventory* page, click *Alerts*, and then select *Create alert*.

[[inventory-conditions]]
== Inventory conditions

Conditions for each alert can be applied to specific metrics relating to the inventory type you select. For example, 
when you select Docker containers, you can add conditions for the CPU usage, memory usage,
inbound traffic, and the outbound traffic metrics. When creating the alert, you can select to still get notified
if no data is returned for the specific metric, or if the alert fails to query {es}.

In this example, Kubernetes Pods is the selected inventory type. The conditions state that an alert is triggered
if memory usage is above 95% for any of the pods within the `ingress-nginx` namespace.

day, week, or month.
