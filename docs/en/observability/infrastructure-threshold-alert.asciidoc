[[infrastructure-threshold-alert]]
= Create an infrastructure threshold alert

Based on the resources that are listed on the *Inventory* page within the {metrics-app},
you can create a threshold alert to notify you when a metric has reached or exceeded a value for a specific
resource or for a group of resources within your infrastructure.

Additionally, each alert can be defined using multiple
conditions that combine metrics and thresholds to create precise notifications and reduce false positives.

. In the side navigation, expand *Observability*, and then click *Metrics*.
. On the *Inventory* page, click *Alerts*, and then select *Create alert*.

[TIP]
==============================================
When you select *Create alert*, the alert will automatically be populated with the same parameters that you've configured on the *Inventory* page. You can use the Inventory view to first visualize which nodes in your infrastructure you'd like to be notified about, and then quickly create an alert in just a few clicks.
==============================================

[[inventory-conditions]]
== Inventory conditions

Conditions for each alert can be applied to specific metrics relating to the inventory type you select. For example, 
when you select Docker containers, you can add conditions for the CPU usage, memory usage,
inbound traffic, and the outbound traffic metrics. When creating the alert, you can select to still get notified
if no data is returned for the specific metric, or if the alert fails to query {es}.

In this example, Kubernetes Pods is the selected inventory type. The conditions state that an alert is triggered
if memory usage is above 95% for any of the pods within the `ingress-nginx` namespace.

Before creating an alert, you can preview whether the alert would have been triggered in the last hour,
day, week, or month.

[[action-types-infrastructure]]
== Action types

You can extend your alerts by connecting them to actions that use the following supported built-in integrations.

=== Action variables

This section details the variables that infrastructure threshold alerts will send to your actions.

[float]
==== Basic variables

image::images/basic-variables.png[The default infrastructure threshold alert message detailing basic variables]

The default message for a infrastructure threshold alert shows an example of how to use its most basic variables.

context.group:: This variable resolves to the **group** on which the alert's condition was detected. For Inventory alerts, this will be the name of a monitored host, pod, container, etc. For Metric Threshold alerts, this will be the value of the field specified in the **Create alert per** field, or `*` if the alert is configured to aggregate your entire infrastructure.
context.alertState:: This variable will resolve to `ALERT`, `NO DATA`, or `ERROR`, depending on why this action is firing. `ALERT` means the alert's condition has been detected, `NO DATA` means no data was returned for the time period that the alert queried, and `ERROR` indicates an error when trying to query the data.
context.reason:: This variable provides a plain English description of why the alert is in its current state. For each of the alert's conditions, it will include the **detected value** of the monitored **metric**, and a description of the **threshold** it crossed.
context.timestamp:: This variable resolves to the timestamp at which the alert evaluated.


[float]
==== Advanced variables

image::images/advanced-variables.png[The default infrastructure threshold alert message detailing advanced variables]

There may be cases when you'd like to customize your action message instead of using `context.reason` to provide all the information you need. Infrastructure threshold alerts will also provide some advanced context variables that have a tree structure.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
These variables have to be used with the structure of `{{context.[Variable Name].condition[Number]}}`. For example, `{{context.value.condition0}}`, `{{context.value.condition1}}`, and so on. Do this even if your alert has only one condition (accessible with `.condition0`). Using just `{{context.[Variable Name]}}` will evaluate to a blank line or `[object Object]` depending on the action type.
==============================================

context.value.condition[X]:: This variable resolves to the detected value of conditions 0, 1, 2, etc.
context.value.threshold[X]:: This variable resolves to the threshold values of conditions 0, 1, 2, etc.
context.value.metric[X]:: This variable resolves to the monitored metric of conditions 0, 1, 2, etc.
