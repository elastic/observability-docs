[[add-logs-service-name]]
= Add a service name to logs

Adding the `service.name` field to your logs associates them with the services that generate them.
You can use this field to view and manage logs for distributed services located on multiple hosts.

To add a service name to your logs, either:

* Use the `add_fields` processor through an integration, {agent} configuration, or {filebeat} configuration.
* Map an existing field from your data stream to the `service.name` field.

== Use the add fields processor to add a service name

For log data without a service name, use the {fleet-guide}/add_fields-processor.html[add_fields processor] to add the `service.name` field.
You can add the processor in an integration's settings or in the {agent} or {filebeat} configuration.

For example, adding the `add_fields` processor to the inputs section of a standalone {agent} or {filebeat} configuration would add `your_service_name` as the `service.name` field:

[source,console]
----
processors:
    - add_fields:
        target: service
        fields:
            name: your_service_name
----

Adding the `add_fields` processor to an integration's settings would add `your_service_name` as the `service.name` field:

[[map-an-existing-field-to-the-service-name-field]]
== Map an existing field to the service name field

For logs that with an existing field being used to represent the service name, map that field to the `service.name` field using the {ref}/field-alias.html[alias field type].
Follow these steps to update your mapping:

. From the main {kib} menu, go to **Stack Management** → **Index Management** → **Index Templates**.
. Search for the index template you want to update.
. From the **Actions** menu for that template, select **Edit**.
. Go to **Mappings**, and select **Add field**.
. Under **Field type**, select **Alias** and add `service.name` to the **Field name**.
. Under **Field path**, select the existing field you want to map to the service name.
. Select **Add field**.

For more ways to add a field to your mapping, refer to {ref}/explicit-mapping.html#add-field-mapping[add a field to an existing mapping].
