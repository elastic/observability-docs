// PR description
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The following topics stuck out to me as key topics for documentation:
// * How synthetics works
// * Quickstart with Docker template
// * Create your own tests
//   * Single test
//   * Test suite
// * Command line reference

// I'm not entirely sure how this fits into the Observability documentation at this point. I'm combining everything into one file as a start.

// I may be completely off base here, but I think it makes sense to keep the Uptime instructions separate from the Synthetics instructions. There are a couple reasons:
// * One is still in alpha and it easily separates the two
// * Uptime is much..simpler to get started with. I don't think we should clutter the getting started experience of either by including more information.

Synthetics provides rich, consistent, and repeatable data that you can trend and alert on.

== How it works


// Operational use case
image::images/synthetics-overview.png[Synthetics overview]
// HB schedules test runs and supervises execution of @elastic/synthetics package
// HB formats data for ES
// @elasic/synthetics runs the tests and gathers performance data which it reports HB
// Do we need a separate image for the --> suite of tests in user-controlled git repo?


Fork a new NPM package
That runs custom JavaScript
Invokes the Playwright library
Which starts a new browser process (completes your tests)
Sends the data via JSON back to Heartbeat w/Synthetics module


// Text goes here. It really does.
// Maybe a diagram?
// Who knows.
