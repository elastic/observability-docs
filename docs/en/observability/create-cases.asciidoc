= Cases

Cases are used to open and track observability issues directly in the Elastic {observability} app.
All cases list the original reporter and all the users who contribute to a case (participants).
You can also send cases to third party systems by <<cases-external-connectors,configuring external connectors>>.

NOTE: If you create cases in {stack-manage-app} or the {security-app}, they are not
visible in {observability}. Likewise, the cases you create in {observability}
are not visible in {stack-manage-app} or the {security-app}.
You also cannot attach alerts from {stack-manage-app} or the {security-app} to
cases in {observability}.
