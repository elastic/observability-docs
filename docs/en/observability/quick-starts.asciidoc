= Quick starts

The quick starts in this section describe how to use {agent} to send data to the
{stack}. With {agent} you can collect all forms of data from anywhere with a
single unified agent per host (some restrictions apply).

* <<quick-start-traces>>

Prefer to use our legacy {beats} for your use case? Refer to:

* <<ingest-logs>>

* <<ingest-metrics>>

* <<ingest-uptime>>

* <<instrument-apps>>

Not sure whether to use {beats} or {agent}? Refer to
{fleet-guide}/beats-agent-comparison.html[{beats} and {agent} capabilities].
