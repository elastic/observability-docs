[[synthetics-role-read]]
= Reader role

For users who need to view and create visualizations that access Synthetics data,
provide read access. Two types of read access are outlined below:

* *General read access*: For most users, you can use <<synthetics-read-privileges-general>>,
which grants read access to all {kib} apps and requires little configuration.
* *Limited read access*: If you want to limit read access to the {synthetics-app} only,
you can use <<synthetics-read-privileges-limited>>, which requires additional configuration.

= General read access

For users who only need to view results in {kib},
use the `viewer` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role].

[[synthetics-read-privileges-limited]]
= Limited read access

If you want to limit read access to the {synthetics-app} only, do _not_ use the
`viewer` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role].

Instead to you can create a reader role, called something like `synthetics_reader_limited`,
and grant the following privileges:
