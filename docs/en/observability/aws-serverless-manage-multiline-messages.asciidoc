[[aws-serverless-manage-multiline-messages]]
= Manage multiline messages

Forwarded content may contain messages that span multiple lines of text. For example, multiline messages are common in files that contain Java stack traces. In order to correctly handle these multiline events, you need to configure `multiline` settings for a specific input to specify which lines are part of a single event.

[[aws-serverless-multiline-config]]
== Configuration options

You can specify the following options for a specific input in the config file to control how the Elastic Serverless Forwarder deals with messages that span multiple lines.

[source, yaml]
----
inputs:
  - type: "s3-sqs"
    id: "arn:aws:sqs:%REGION%:%ACCOUNT%:%QUEUENAME%"
    multiline:
      type: pattern
      pattern: '^\\['
      negate: true
      match: after
    outputs:
      - type: "elasticsearch"
        args:
          elasticsearch_url: "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-central-1:123456789:secret:es_url"
          username: "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789:secret:es_secrets:username"
          password: "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789:secret:es_secrets:password"
          es_datastream_name: "logs-generic-default"
----

The Elastic Serverless Forwarder takes all the lines that do not start with `[` and combines them with the previous line that does. For example, you could use this configuration to join the following lines of a multiline message into a single event:

[source, shell]
----
[beat-logstash-some-name-832-2015.11.28] IndexNotFoundException[no such index]
    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexNameExpressionResolver$WildcardExpressionResolver.resolve(IndexNameExpressionResolver.java:566)
    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexNameExpressionResolver.concreteIndices(IndexNameExpressionResolver.java:133)
    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexNameExpressionResolver.concreteIndices(IndexNameExpressionResolver.java:77)
    at org.elasticsearch.action.admin.indices.delete.TransportDeleteIndexAction.checkBlock(TransportDeleteIndexAction.java:75)
----

NOTE: Note that you should escape the opening square bracket (`[`) in the regular expression, because it specifies a character class i.e. a set of characters that you wish to match. You also have to escape the backslash (`\`) used for escaping the opening square bracket as raw strings are not used. Thus, `^\\[` will produce the required regular expression upon compiling.

`inputs.[].multiline.type` defines which aggregation method to use. The default is `pattern`. The other options are `count`, which enables you to aggregate a constant number of lines, and `while_pattern`, which aggregates lines by pattern without matching options.

`inputs.[].multiline.pattern` differs from the patterns supported by {ls}. See https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax[Python's 3.9 regular expression syntax] for a list of supported regexp patterns. Depending on how you configure other multiline options, lines that match the specified regular expression are considered either continuations of a previous line or the start of a new multiline event.

`inputs.[].multiline.negate` defines whether the pattern is negated. The default is `false`. This setting works only with `pattern` and `while_pattern` types.

`inputs.[].multiline.match` changes the grouping of multiple lines according to the schema below (works only with `pattern` type):

//[cols="2*<a"]
|===
| Setting for `negate` | Setting for `match` | Result                      | Example `pattern: ^b`
| `false`                    | `after`             | Consecutive lines that match the pattern are appended to the previous line that doesn’t match.    | image:images/false-after-multi.png[Lines a b b c b b become "abb" and "cbb"]
| `false`                    | `before`             | Consecutive lines that match the pattern are prepended to the next line that doesn’t match.       | image:images/false-after-multi.png[Lines b b a b b c become "bba" and "bbc"]
| `true`                     | `after`             | Consecutive lines that don’t match the pattern are appended to the previous line that does match. | image:images/true-after-multi.png[Lines b a c b d e become "bac" and "bde"]
| `false`                    | `before`             | Consecutive lines that don’t match the pattern are prepended to the next line that does match.    | image:images/true-before-multi.png[Lines a c b d e b become "acb" and "deb"]
|===

NOTE: The `after` setting is equivalent to `previous` in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-multiline.html[{ls}], and `before` is equivalent to `next`.

`inputs.[].multiline.flush_pattern` specifies a regular expression, in which the current multiline will be flushed from memory, ending the multiline-message. Works only with `pattern` type.

`inputs.[].multiline.max_lines` defines the maximum number of lines that can be combined into one event. If the multiline message contains more than `max_lines`, any additional lines are truncated from the event. The default is `500`.

`inputs.[].multiline.max_bytes` defines the maximum number of bytes that can be combined into one event. If the multiline message contains more than `max_bytes`, any additional content is truncated from the event. The default is `10485760`.

`inputs.[].multiline.count_lines` defines the number of lines to aggregate into a single event. Works only with `count` type.

`inputs.[].multiline.skip_newline` defined whether multiline events must be concatenated, stripping the line separator. If set to `true`, the line separator will be stripped. The default is `false`.

[[aws-serverless-multiline-config-examples]]
== Examples of multiline configuration

The examples in this section cover the following use cases:

-   Combining a Java stack trace into a single event
-   Combining C-style line continuations into a single event
-   Combining multiple lines from time-stamped events

[[aws-serverless-multiline-config-example-java]]
=== Java stack traces

Java stack traces consist of multiple lines, with each line after the initial line beginning with whitespace, as in this example:

[source, java]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)
        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)
        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)
----

This configuration merges any line that begins with whitespace up to the previous line:

[source, yaml]
----
multiline:
  type: pattern
  pattern: '^\s'
  negate: false
  match: after
----

This is a slightly more complex Java stack trace example:

[source, java]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: A book has a null property
       at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookIds(Author.java:38)
       at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
       at com.example.myproject.Book.getId(Book.java:22)
       at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookIds(Author.java:35)
       ... 1 more
----

To consolidate these lines into a single event, use the following multiline configuration:

[source, yaml]
----
multiline:
  type: pattern
  pattern: '^\s+(at|.{3})\s+\\b|^Caused by:'
  negate: false
  match: after
----

In this example, the pattern matches and merges the following lines:
-   a line that begins with spaces followed by the word `at` or `...`
-   a line that begins with the words `Caused by:`

NOTE: In Python’s string literals, `\b` is the backspace character (ASCII value 8). As raw strings are not used, Python would convert the `\b` to a backspace. In order for our regular expression to match as expected, you need to escape the backslash `\` in `\b` to `\\b`, which will produce the correct regular expression upon compiling.


[[aws-serverless-multiline-line-continuations]]
=== Line continuations

Several programming languages use the backslash (`\`) character at the end of a line to denote that the line continues, as in this example:

[source, c]
----
printf ("%10.10ld  \t %10.10ld \t %s\
  %f", w, x, y, z );
----

To consolidate these lines into a single event, use the following multiline configuration:

[source, yaml]
----
multiline:
  type: pattern
  pattern: '\\\\$'
  negate: false
  match: after
----

This configuration merges any line that ends with the `\` character with the line that follows it.

NOTE: Note that you should escape the opening square bracket (`[`) in the regular expression, because it specifies a character class i.e. a set of characters that you wish to match. You also have to escape the backslash (`\`) used for escaping the opening square bracket as raw strings are not used. Thus, `^\\[` will produce the required regular expression upon compiling.

[[aws-serverless-multiline-timestamps]]
=== Timestamps
Activity logs from services such as {es} typically begin with a timestamp, followed by information on the specific activity, as in this example:

[source, shell]
----
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,389][INFO ][env                      ] [Letha] using [1] data paths, mounts [[/
(/dev/disk1)]], net usable_space [34.5gb], net total_space [118.9gb], types [hfs]
----

To consolidate these lines into a single event, use the following multiline configuration:

[source, yaml]
----
multiline:
  type: pattern
  pattern: '^\\[[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}'
  negate: true
  match: after
----

This configuration uses the `negate: true` and `match: after` settings to specify that any line that does not match the specified pattern belongs to the previous line.

NOTE: Note that you should escape the opening square bracket (`[`) in the regular expression, because it specifies a character class i.e. a set of characters that you wish to match. You also have to escape the backslash (`\`) used for escaping the opening square bracket as raw strings are not used. Thus, `^\\[` will produce the required regular expression upon compiling.

[[aws-serverless-multiline-application-events]]
=== Application events

Sometimes your application logs contain events, that begin and end with custom markers, such as the following example:

[source, shell]
----
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,389] Start new event
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,395] Content of processing something
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,399] End event
----

To consolidate these lines into a single event, use the following multiline configuration:
[source, yaml]
----
multiline:
  type: pattern
  pattern: 'Start new event'
  negate: true
  match: after
  flush_pattern: 'End event'
----

The `flush_pattern` option specifies a regex at which the current multiline will be flushed. If you think of the `pattern` option specifying the beginning of an event, the `flush_pattern` option will specify the end or last line of the event.

NOTE: This example will not work correctly if start/end log blocks are mixed with non-multiline logs, or if different start/end log blocks overlap with each other. For instance, `Some other log` log lines in the following example will be merged into a *single* multiline document because they neither match `inputs.[].multiline.pattern` nor `inputs.[].multiline.flush_pattern`, and `inputs.[].multiline.negate` is set to `true`.

[source, shell]
----
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,389] Start new event
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,395] Content of processing something
[2015-08-24 11:49:14,399] End event
[2015-08-24 11:50:14,389] Some other log
[2015-08-24 11:50:14,395] Some other log
[2015-08-24 11:50:14,399] Some other log
[2015-08-24 11:51:14,389] Start new event
[2015-08-24 11:51:14,395] Content of processing something
[2015-08-24 11:51:14,399] End event
----

[[aws-serverless-multiline-test-regexp]]
== Test your regexp pattern for multiline

To make it easier for you to test the regexp patterns in your multiline config, you can use this https://replit.com/@AndreaSpacca/Multine-Regexp-Test#main.py[Multine Regexp Test]:
//check name - multine vs multiline

. Plug in the regexp pattern at line `3`, along with the `multiline.negate` setting that you plan to use at line `4`
. Paste a sample message between the three double quote delimiters (`""" """`) at line `5`
. Click `Run` to see which lines in the message match your specified configuration.
