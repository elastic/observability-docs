// THIS CONTENT IS ALSO USED IN THE APM GUIDE
// tag::apm-quick-start[]

This guide describes how to:

* Collect Application Performance Monitoring (APM) data
* Send APM data to the {stack}
* Explore and visualize the data in real-time

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {forum}[discuss forum].

[[add-apm-integration]]
== Step 1: Configure the APM integration

{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {integrations-server} that includes the APM integration.

[[add-apm-integration-agents]]
== Step 2: Install APM agents

APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each {apm-agent}'s configuration–
to the index that its data is stored in {es}.
Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for {apm-agent} and APM Server communication.
This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.

TIP: You can edit your APM integration settings if you need to change the APM Server URL
or secret token to match your APM agents.

[[view-apm-integration-data]]
== Step 3: View your data

Back in {kib}, under {observability}, select APM.
You should see application performance monitoring data flowing into the {stack}!

NOTE: The built-in `apm_user` role is not compatible with the APM integration
as it only provides read access to `apm-*` indices.
For a list of indices users need access to, refer to
{observability-guide}/apm-data-streams.html[APM data streams]

== What's next?

* Now that data is streaming into the {stack}, take your investigation to a
deeper level! Use https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic {observability}]
to unify your logs, metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
https://www.elastic.co/security[{elastic-sec}]. Adding endpoint protection is
just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
{observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Create alerts] and find out about
problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use {ml} to
{observability-guide}/inspect-log-anomalies.html[detect anomalies].

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
other hosts by deploying {agent}s across your infrastructure!
