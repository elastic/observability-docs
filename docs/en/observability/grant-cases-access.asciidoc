| Action | {kib} Privileges
| Give full access to manage cases and settings
a|
* `All` for the *Cases* feature under *{observability}*.
* `All` for the *{connectors-feature}* feature under *Management*.

[NOTE]
====
Roles without `All` *{connectors-feature}* feature privileges cannot create, add, delete, or modify case connectors.

By default, `All` for the **Cases** feature allows you to have full control over cases, including deleting them, editing case settings, and more. You can customize the sub-feature privileges to limit feature access.

least once, which creates a user profile.

NOTE: You can customize sub-feature privileges for deleting cases, deleting alerts and comments from cases, editing case settings, adding case comments and attachements, and re-opening cases.

* `All` for the *Cases* feature under *{observability}*.

// lint enable observability

NOTE: If you are using an on-premises {kib} deployment and want your email
notifications and external incident management systems to contain links back
to {kib}, configure the
{kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[server.publicBaseUrl] setting.
