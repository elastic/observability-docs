= Configure access to cases

// lint ignore observability
To access and send cases to external systems, you need the {subscriptions}[appropriate license],
and your role must have the *Cases* {kib} privilege as a user for the *{observability}* feature.

NOTE: If you are using an on-premises {kib} deployment and want your email
notifications and external incident management systems to contain links back
to {kib}, configure the
{kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[server.publicBaseUrl] setting.

For more details, refer to {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[feature access based on user privileges].
