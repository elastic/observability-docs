[[fleet-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud}
(recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.

Here's what you need for each deployment type:

--
include::{tab-widgets}/prereq-widget.asciidoc[]
--

[[set-up-fleet]]
== Step 1: Set up {fleet}

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get logs, metrics, and security data into the {stack}.

TIP: Not using {fleet}? Advanced users who want to configure and manage
{agent}s manually can
{fleet-guide}/install-standalone-elastic-agent.html[run agents standalone].

The first time you use {fleet}, you might need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{tab-widgets}/add-fleet-server/widget.asciidoc[]

For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[{fleet-server}].

[[add-system-integration]]
== Step 2: Add the {agent} System integration

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query
data from operating systems, and more. A single agent makes it easy and fast to
deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy (a
collection of input settings) that you can update to add integrations for new
data sources, security protections, and more.

In this step, add the System integration to monitor host logs and metrics.

. Go to the {kib} home page and click **Add integrations**.
+
--
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-home.png[{kib} home page]
--

. In the query bar, search for **System** and select the integration to see more
details about it.

. Click **Add System**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
Make sure that **Collect logs from System instances** and
**Collect metrics from System instances** are turned on.

. Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for
your host. For example, if you're  deploying {agent} on macOS hosts, you
need to add a new path to the _System syslog logs_ section by clicking
**Add row** and specifying `/var/log/system.log`.
+

image::images/kibana-agent-add-log-path.png[Configuration page for adding log paths to the {agent} System integration]
--

. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains a system integration policy
for the configuration you just specified. 
+
--

image::images/kibana-system-policy.png[Configuration page for adding the {agent} System integration]
--

. In the popup, click **Add {agent} to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
flyout.
+
TIP: If you accidentally close the popup, go to **{fleet} > Agents**, then click
**Add agent** to access the flyout.

[discrete]
[[add-agent-to-fleet]]
== Step 3: Install and run an {agent} on your machine

The **Add agent** flyout has two options: **Enroll in {fleet}** and
**Run standalone**. The default is to enroll the agents in {fleet}, as this
reduces the amount of work on the person managing the hosts by providing
a centralized management tool in {kib}.

. Skip the **Select enrollment token** step. The enrollment token you need is
already selected.
+
NOTE: The enrollment token is specific to the {agent} policy that you just
created. When you run the command to enroll the agent in {fleet}, you will pass
in the enrollment token.

. Download, install, and enroll the {agent} on your host by selecting
your host operating system and following the **Install {agent} on your host**
step.
+
--
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-agent-flyout.png[Add agent flyout in {kib}]
--
+
It takes about a minute for {agent} to enroll in {fleet}, download the
configuration specified in the policy you just created, and start collecting
data. 

[discrete]
[[view-data]]
== Step 4: Monitor host logs and metrics

. Verify that data is flowing. Wait until agent enrollment is confirmed and
incoming data is received, then click **View assets** to access dashboards
related to the System integration.  
+
--
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-agent-confirm-data.png[Agent confirm data]
--

. Choose a dashboard that is related to the operating system of your
monitored system. Dashboards are available for Microsoft Windows systems
and Unix-like systems (for example, Linux and macOS). 
+
--
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-agent-system-integration-visualizations.png[Agent list of visualizations]
--

. Open the **[Metrics System] Host overview** dashboard to view performance metrics
from your host system.
+

You can hover over any visualization to adjust its settings, or click the
**Edit** button to make changes to the dashboard. To learn more, refer to
{kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[Dashboard and visualizations].

[[add-synthetics-integration]]
== Step 5: Monitor services using real browsers and lightweight HTTP, TCP, and ICMP checks
[discrete]

beta[] Next, you’ll add the Elastic Synthetics integration, enabling you to monitor the
status and response times of applications and services in real time. You can monitor
the availability of network endpoints via HTTP, TCP, ICMP or Browser monitors.

Add the Elastic Synthetics integration to your agent policy. You use policies to
manage settings across a group of agents. An agent policy may contain any number
of integrations for collecting observability data from the various services
running on your host.

. In {kib}, go to the **Integrations** page (click **Add integrations** in the
home page or main menu).

. In the query bar, search for **Elastic Synthetics** and select the integration
to see more details about it.

. Click **Add Elastic Synthetics**.

. Configure the integration name and select your desired monitor type from the
following monitor types:
+
|===

| **HTTP** | Connects via HTTP and verifies that the host returns the expected response.

For detailed information about HTTP options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-http-options.html[{heartbeat}] documentation.

| **TCP** | Connects via TCP and verifies the endpoint by sending and receiving a custom payload.
By default, the hostname and port are required.

For detailed information about TCP options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-tcp-options.html[{heartbeat}] documentation.

| **ICMP** | Uses an ICMP `v4` and `v6` Echo Request to ping the configured hosts. By default,
the host name is required.

For detailed information about ICMP options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-icmp-options.html[{heartbeat}] documentation.

| **Browser** a| Runs automated tests using a real Chromium browser via the synthetics agent.

For detailed information about browser options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-browser-options.html[{heartbeat}] documentation.

NOTE: To create a **browser** monitor, you must use the elastic-agent-complete Docker container as this contains the dependencies necessary to run browser monitors. To learn more, refer to <<uptime-set-up>>.

|===

. Enter the URL you want to monitor for availability, and select a monitor interval in seconds or minutes. By default, a monitoring
schedule of every 3 minutes is selected.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-synthetics-integration.png[{fleet} Add Synthetics integration page]

. The **HTTP** and **TCP** monitor types both support TLS. Under **TLS settings**, select **Enable
TLS configuration**. Click the down arrow next to advanced HTTP or TCP options, and then
enter your required settings.

. Under **Where to add this integration**, select *Existing hosts*, then select
the agent policy you created earlier. That way, you can deploy the change to
the agent that's already running.

. When you're done, click **Save and continue**, then **Save and deploy changes**.

. To see the updated policy, click the agent policy link, for example,
*Agent policy 1*.
+
The newly added Elastic Synthetics integration should appear on the
**Integrations** tab in the agent policy, along with the System integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-synthetics.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with synthetics-1 datasource]
+
All {agent}s that use this policy will collect logs, metrics, and uptime data from the host.

. To view the data in the {observability-guide}/view-monitor-status.html[{uptime-app}], go to
**{observability} > Uptime** in the main menu.

[discrete]
[[add-nginx-integration]]
== Step 5: Monitor Nginx logs and metrics
[discrete]

Next, add an Nginx integration to the policy used by your agent.

NOTE: For these steps, we assume that you have `nginx` running on your host, and
want to collect logs and metrics from it. If not, you can skip this part of the
guide.

. In {kib}, go to the **Integrations** page.

. In the query bar, search for **Nginx** and select the integration to see more
details about it.

. Click **Add Nginx**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.

. Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for
your host. You may need to change the **Paths** settings.

. Under **Where to add this integration**, select *Existing hosts*, then select
the agent policy you created earlier. That way, you can deploy the change to
the agent that's already running.

. When you're done, click **Save and continue**, then **Save and deploy changes**.

. To see the updated policy, click the agent policy link.
+
The newly added Nginx integration should appear on the **Integrations** tab in
your agent policy, along with the System and Elastic Synthetics integrations.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-nginx.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with nginx-1 datasource]
+
All {agent}s that use this policy will collect logs and metrics from the
Nginx server and the host, along with system logs and uptime data.

. To view the data, go to **Management > {fleet}**, then click the
**Data streams** tab.

. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
to the data stream.
