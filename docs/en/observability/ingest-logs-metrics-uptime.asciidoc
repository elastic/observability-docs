<titleabbrev>Ingest logs, metrics, and uptime data</titleabbrev>
++++

[[fleet-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

* You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our
{ess-product}[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud} (recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.
+
Here's what you need for each deployment type:
+
--
include::{tab-widgets}/prereq-widget.asciidoc[]
--

* An internet connection is required for {kib} to download integration packages
from the Elastic Package Registry. Make sure the {kib} server can connect to
`https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`.

* {fleet} is currently only available to users with the
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[superuser role].

[[set-up-fleet]]
== Step 1: Set up {fleet}

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get logs, metrics, and security data into the {stack}.

TIP: Not using {fleet}? Advanced users who want to configure and manage
{agent}s manually can
{fleet-guide}/install-standalone-elastic-agent.html[run agents standalone].

The first time you use {fleet}, you might need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{tab-widgets}/add-fleet-server/widget.asciidoc[]

For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[{fleet-server}].

[discrete]
[[add-agent-to-fleet]]
== Step 2: Add an {agent} to {fleet}

{agent} is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.

To send logs and metrics to the {stack}:

include::{fleet-repo-dir}/elastic-agent/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.asciidoc[tag=agent-enroll]

[discrete]
[[view-data]]
== Step 3: Monitor host logs and metrics

Next, view the data sent by {agent}. Right now, {agent} is only sending data
about the host system because you haven't configured the agent to collect data
from other sources yet.

To see host logs and metrics:

. In {fleet}, click the **Data streams** tab.
. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
to the data stream. For example, to see host metrics, select one of the system
datasets:

+
Then navigate to the [Metrics System] Host overview dashboard:

[[add-synthetics-integration]]
== Step 4: Monitor services using real browsers and lightweight HTTP, TCP, and ICMP checks
[discrete]

beta[] Next, youâ€™ll add the Elastic Synthetics integration, enabling you to monitor the
status and response times of applications and services in real time. You can monitor
the availability of network endpoints via HTTP, TCP, ICMP or Browser monitors.

Add the Elastic Synthetics integration to the default policy used by your agent.
You use policies to manage settings across a group of agents. An agent policy may
contain any number of integrations for collecting observability data from the various
services running on your host.

. In {kib}, go to **Management > Integrations**,
and search for the **Elastic Synthetics** integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-synthetics.png[{fleet} showing Synthetics integration]
. Click the Elastic Synthetics integration to see more details about it, then click
**Add Elastic Synthetics**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-synthetics-overview.png[{fleet} showing Synthetics integration overview]

. On the **Add Elastic Synthetics integration** page, under **Configure integration**,
enter the integration name and select your desired monitor type from the following monitor types:
+
|===

| *HTTP* | Connects via HTTP and verifies that the host returns the expected response.

For detailed information
about HTTP options, refer to our {heartbeat-ref}/monitor-http-options.html[Heartbeat] documentation.

| *TCP* | Connects via TCP and verifies the endpoint by sending and receiving a custom payload.
By default, the hostname and port are required.

For detailed information about TCP options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-tcp-options.html[Heartbeat] documentation.

| *ICMP* | Uses an ICMP `v4` and `v6` Echo Request to ping the configured hosts. By default,
the host name is required.

For detailed information about ICMP options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-icmp-options.html[Heartbeat] documentation.

| *Browser* | Runs automated tests using a real Chromium browser via the synthetics agent.

For detailed information about browser options, refer to our
{heartbeat-ref}/monitor-browser-options.html[Heartbeat] documentation.

NOTE: To create a *browser* monitor, you must use the elastic-agent-complete Docker container as this contains the dependencies to run browser monitors. To learn more, refer to <<synthetics-quickstart-fleet>>.

|===

. Enter the URL you want to monitor for availability and select a monitor interval in seconds or minutes. By default, a monitoring
schedule of every 3 minutes is selected.

. The *HTTP* and *TCP* monitor types both support TLS. Under *TLS settings*, select *Enable
TLS configuration*. Click the down arrow next to advanced HTTP or TCP options, and then
enter your required settings.

. Under *Apply to agent policy*, select the `default policy`.
+
****
In this guide, you add integrations to the default policy created by
{kib}. After you learn the basics, you can create your own policies and assign
them to agents.

image::images/add-synthetics-integration.png[{fleet} Add Synthetics integration page]

. When you're done, click *Save integration*, then *Save and deploy changes*.

. To see the updated policy, click the *Default policy* link.
+
The newly added Elastic Synthetics integration should appear under **Integrations** in the
default policy, along with the `system-1` integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-synthetics.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with synthetics-1 datasource]
+
All {agent}s that use this policy will collect logs, metrics, and uptime data from the host.

. To view the data in the {observability-guide}/view-monitor-status.html[Uptime app], go to
**Observability > Uptime**.

[discrete]
[[add-nginx-integration]]
== Step 5: Monitor Nginx logs and metrics
[discrete]

Next, you'll browse a catalog of integrations, then add an Nginx integration to
the default policy used by your agent.

NOTE: For these steps, we assume that you have `nginx` running on some of your
infrastructure, and want to collect logs and metrics from it.

. In {kib}, go back to **Management > Integrations**,
and search for the **Nginx** integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-nginx.png[{fleet} showing Nginx integration]
. Click the Nginx integration to see more details about it, then click
**Add Nginx**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-nginx-overview.png[{fleet} showing Nginx integration overview]

. On the **Add Nginx integration** page, select the default policy.
+
****
In this guide, you add integrations to the default policy created by
{kib}. After you learn the basics, you can create your own policies and assign
them to agents.
****
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-integration.png[{fleet} Add Nginx integration page]

. Under **Configure integration**, click the down arrow next to enabled streams
and make sure the **Paths** are correct for your host. Inspect or change other
settings

. When you're done, save and deploy the changes.

. To see the updated policy, click the *Default policy* link.
+
The newly added Nginx integration should appear under **Integrations** in the
default policy, along with the `system-1` and `synthetics-1` integrations.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-nginx.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with nginx-1 datasource]
+
All {agent}s that use this policy will collect logs and metrics from the
Nginx server and the host, along with uptime data.

. To view the data, go to *Management > {fleet}*, then click the
**Data streams** tab.

. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
to the data stream.
