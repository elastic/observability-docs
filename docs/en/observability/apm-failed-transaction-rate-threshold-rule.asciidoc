[[apm-failed-transaction-rate-threshold-rule]]
= Failed transaction rate threshold rule

Alert when the rate of transaction errors in a service exceeds a defined threshold.

[discrete]
== Filters and conditions

Filter the transactions coming from your application to apply an Failed transaction rate threshold rule to a specific
service (`SERVICE`), environment (`ENVIRONMENT`), transaction type (`TYPE`), or transaction name (`NAME`).
Alternatively, you can use a {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[KQL filter] to limit the scope of the alert
by toggling on the *Use KQL Filter* option.

Then, you can specify which conditions should result in an alert. This includes specifying:

* The percent of transactions that failed (`IS ABOVE`).
* The timeframe in which the failures must occur (`FOR THE LAST`) in seconds, minutes, hours, or days.

.Example
****
This example creates a rule for all production services that would result in an alert when at least 30%
of transactions failed in the last hour:

Alternatively, you can use a KQL filter to limit the scope of the alert:

. Toggle on *Use KQL Filter*.
. Add a filter:
