[[application-logs]]
= Application logs

Application logs provide valuable insight into events that have occurred within your services and applications.

There are two aspects to consider when monitoring application logs:

- <<log-types,log format>>: are your logs plaintext or Elastic Common Schema (ECS) logs (structured JSON)
- <<ingest-application-logs,log ingestion>>: the tool you use to send and write logs to Elasticsearch

The format of your logs (structured or plaintext) influences your log ingestion strategy.
For simplicity, this documentation uses {filebeat} for ingestion, but any log ingestion tool can be used with an equivalent configuration.

Application logs can be correlated to APM services with <<log-correlation,log correlation>>.

Using an APM agent provides extra features:

- <<log-correlation,log correlation>>: correlate logs to APM traces
- <<log-reformatting,log reformatting>>: reformat logs to ECS
- <<apm-agent-log-sending,log sending>>: reformat and send logs without extra ingestion tool

[[log-types]]
== Plaintext logs vs. ECS logs

Logs are typically produced as either plaintext or structured.
Plaintext logs contain only text and have no special formatting, for example:

[source,log]
----
2019-08-06T12:09:12.375Z INFO:spring-petclinic: Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path, org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer
2019-08-06T12:09:12.379Z INFO:spring-petclinic: Started PetClinicApplication in 7.095 seconds (JVM running for 9.082), org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication
2019-08-06T14:08:40.199Z DEBUG:spring-petclinic: init find form, org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner.OwnerController
----

Structured logs, on the other hand, follow a predefined, repeatable pattern or structure.
This structure is applied at write time--preventing the need for parsing at ingest time.
The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields to use when structuring logs.
This structure allows logs to be easily ingested,
and provides the ability to correlate, search, and aggregate on individual fields within your logs.

For example, the same example shown above might look like this when structured with ECS-compatable JSON:

[source,json]
----
{"@timestamp":"2019-08-06T12:09:12.375Z", "log.level": "INFO", "message":"Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''", "service.name":"spring-petclinic","process.thread.name":"restartedMain","log.logger":"org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer"}
{"@timestamp":"2019-08-06T12:09:12.379Z", "log.level": "INFO", "message":"Started PetClinicApplication in 7.095 seconds (JVM running for 9.082)", "service.name":"spring-petclinic","process.thread.name":"restartedMain","log.logger":"org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication"}
{"@timestamp":"2019-08-06T14:08:40.199Z", "log.level":"DEBUG", "message":"init find form", "service.name":"spring-petclinic","process.thread.name":"http-nio-8080-exec-8","log.logger":"org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner.OwnerController","transaction.id":"28b7fb8d5aba51f1","trace.id":"2869b25b5469590610fea49ac04af7da"}
----

There are two ways to make your application write ECS-formatted logs:
- use an {ecs-logging-ref}/intro.html[ECS logging] library
- use an APM agent and <<log-reformatting,log reformatting>>

[float]
[[log-reformatting]]
== Log reformatting

Elastic APM agents can automatically reformat application logs to Elastic Common Schema (ECS) format
without needing to add an ECS logger dependency or modify the application.

This feature is supported for the following APM agents:
* Ruby
* Python
* {apm-java-ref}/logs.html[Java]

[float]
[[log-correlation]]
== Log correlation

Log correlation works at two levels:

- at service level: annotation with `service.name`, `service.version` and `service.environment` allow to link logs with APM services
- at trace level: annotation with `trace.id` and `transaction.id` allow to link logs with traces

Elastic APM integrates with the most popular logging frameworks in each programming language to accomplish this automatically.

// tag::correlate-logs[]
Correlating your application logs with trace events allows you to:

* view the context of a log and the parameters a user provided
* view all logs belonging to a particular trace
* easily move between logs and traces when debugging application issues in {kib}

Learn more about log correlation in the APM Guide: {apm-guide-ref}/log-correlation.html[log correlation],
or in any of the agent-specific ingestion guides:

* {apm-go-ref}/log-correlation.html[Go]
* {apm-java-ref}/logs.html[Java]
* {apm-dotnet-ref}/log-correlation.html[.NET]
* {apm-node-ref}/log-correlation.html[Node.js]
* {apm-py-ref}/log-correlation.html[Python]
* {apm-ruby-ref}/log-correlation.html[Ruby]

[[ingest-application-logs]]
== How to ingest application logs

There are four main ways to ingest application logs into the {stack}.
Your use case will help determine the method that's right for you.

Here, {filebeat} is used for reference, but any ingestion tool
can be used with an equivalent configuration.

* <<overview-ecs-logging-logs>>
* <<overview-log-reformatting>>
* <<overview-apm-agent-log-sending>>

[float]
[[overview-plaintext-logs]]
=== Plaintext logs

// tag::plaintext-logs[]
Use {filebeat} to parse and ingest raw, plain-text application logs.

**Requirements**

* (Optional) Elastic APM agent for your programming language (for log correlation)
* Raw, plain-text application logs stored on the file system
* {filebeat} configured to monitor and capture application logs

**Pros**

* All programming languages/frameworks are supported
* Existing application logs can be ingested
* Does not require modification of the application or its configuration, unless log correlation is required

**Cons**

* Must parse application logs to be usefulâ€”meaning writing and maintaining Grok patterns and spending CPU cycles on parsing
* Parsing is tied to the application log format, meaning it can differ per application and needs to be maintained over time
* Log correlation requires modifying the application log format and inject IDs in log messages
// end::plaintext-logs[]

**Cons**

* Not all frameworks are supported
* Requires modification of the application and its log configuration
// end::ecs-logging-logs[]

Learn more: <<ecs-logging-logs>>

[float]
[[overview-log-reformatting]]
=== Log reformatting

// tag::log-reformatting[]
Elastic APM agents can automatically reformat application logs to Elastic Common Schema (ECS) format
without needing to add an ECS logger dependency or modify the application.

**Requirements**

* The Elastic APM agent for your programming language
* {filebeat} configured to monitor and capture application logs

**Pros**

All the benefits of using ECS logging, without having to modify the application or its configuration:

[float]
[[overview-apm-agent-log-sending]]
=== APM agent log sending

// tag::apm-agent-log-sending[]
Elastic APM agents can automatically capture and send logs directly to APM Server--enabling you to
easily ingest log events without needing a separate log shipper like {filebeat}.

**Requirements**

The Elastic APM agent for your programming language.

**Pros**

* Simple to set up as it only relies on the APM agent
* No modification of the application required
* No need to deploy {filebeat}
* No need to store log files in the file system.

**Cons**

* Experimental feature

=== Step 2: Parse logs at ingest time

A downside of plaintext logs is that you can't aggregate or search on the fields within the logs.
To enable these features, you'll need to parse the contents of your logs into ECS-compatible fields.
