You do not need to configure any settings to use the APM UI. It is enabled by default.
If you'd like to adjust the default settings, see {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[APM Settings].

=== APM Indices

The APM UI uses data views to query APM indices.
To change the default APM indices that the APM UI queries, open the APM UI and select **Settings** > **Indices**.
Index settings in the APM UI take precedence over those set in `kibana.yml`.

APM indices are {kib} Spaces-aware;
Changes to APM index settings will only apply to the currently enabled space.
See <<apm-spaces>> for more information.
