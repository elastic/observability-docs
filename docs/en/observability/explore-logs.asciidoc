[[explore-logs]]
= Logs Explorer

beta[]

With **Logs Explorer**, you can quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
You can also customize and save your searches and place them on a dashboard.
Instead of having to log into different servers, change directories, and view individual files, all your logs are available in a single view.

From the {observability} navigation menu, click **Explorer** under the **Logs** heading to open Logs Explorer.

[[find-your-logs]]
== Find your logs

By default, Logs Explorer shows all of your logs.

Once you have the logs you want to focus on displayed, you can drill down further to find the information you need.

[[update-the-documents-table]]
== Update the documents table

The documents table in Logs Explorer functions similarly to the table in Discover.
You can add fields, order table columns, sort fields, and update the row height in the same way you would in Discover.

Refer to the {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover] documentation for more information.

[[view-log-details]]
== View log details

Click the expand icon (image:images/expand-icon.png[icon to open log details]) to get an in-depth look at an individual log file.

These details provide immediate feedback and context for what's happening and where it's happening for each log.
From here, you can quickly debug errors and investigate the services where errors have occurred.

The following actions help you filter and focus on specific fields in the log details:

* **Filter for value (image:images/plusInCircle.png[filter for value icon]):** Show logs that contain the specific field value.
* **Filter out value (image:images/minusInCircle.png[filter out value icon]):** Show logs that do *not* contain the specific field value.
* **Filter for field present (image:images/filter.png[filter for present icon]):** Show logs that contain the specific field.
* **Toggle column in table (image:images/listAdd.png[toggle column in table icon]):** Add or remove a column for the field to the main Logs Explorer table.
