= Create monitors with Project Monitors

++++
<titleabbrev>Use Project Monitors</titleabbrev>

beta[]

Projects are the most powerful and sophisticated way to configure synthetic monitors in the {stack}. Projects let you define your infrastructure as code, more commonly known as IaaC or Git-ops. With project monitors you organize your YAML configuration and JavaScript- or TypeScript-defined monitors on the filesystem, use Git for version control, and deploy via a CLI tool, usually executed on a CI/CD platform.

== Prerequisites

To try this beta functionality, first you need to enable Monitor Management in {kib}:

. Go to **{observability}** -> **Uptime**.
. Click **Monitor Management**.
. Review the terms and conditions and click **Enable** to start using Monitor Management.

[IMPORTANT]
======
To enable Monitor Management, you must be logged into {kib} as a user with
the following privileges:

* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster privileges]: `monitor`, `read_ilm`, `read_pipeline`, and at least one of `manage_own_api_key`, `manage_security`, or `manage_api_key`
* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges] for `synthetics-*`: `view_index_metadata`, `create_doc`, `auto_configure`
======

Working with projects requires working with the Elastic Synthetics CLI tool, which
can be invoked via the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command. Before getting started
you'll need to:

. Install https://nodejs.dev/en/[Node.js]
. Install the package:
+
[source,sh]
----
npm install -g @elastic/synthetics
----
. To display the help menu and confirm your system is setup correctly, run:
+
[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics -h
----

[NOTE]
====
You can run monitors on one or both of the following:

* *Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure*:
  With Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure, you can create and run monitors in multiple
  locations without having to manage your own infrastructure.
  Elastic takes care of software updates and capacity planning for you.
* *Private locations*: Private locations allow you to run monitors from your own premises.
  To use private locations you must create a private location before continuing.
  For step-by-step instructions, refer to <<synthetics-private-location>>.

== Create a project

Start by creating your first project. Run the command below to create a new 
project named `projects-test` in the current directory.

[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics init projects-test
----

Then, follow the prompts on screen to setup the correct default variables for your project.
When complete, set the `SYNTHETICS_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal, which is used
for authentication with your {stack}:

. To generate an API key:
.. Go to **Monitor Management** in the {uptime-app}.
.. Click **API Keys**.
.. Click **Generate API key**.
+
image::images/synthetics-monitor-management-api-key.png[API Keys tooltip on the Uptime app's Monitor Management page]

. Set the `SYNTHETICS_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal.
  You will most likely want to set this permanently. 
  This is done differently in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.2#saving-changes-to-environment-variables[Powershell] and https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/117470[Bash].

NOTE: If you are pushing to a <<synthetics-private-location,private location>>, you must use an API key generated in 8.4 or higher.

Then, take a look at key files and directories inside your project:

* `journeys` is where you'll add `.yaml`, `.ts`, and `.js` files defining your monitors. When you create a new project, this directory will contain files defining sample monitors.
* `synthetics.config.ts` contains settings for your project. When you create a new project, it will contain some basic configuration options that you can customize later.
* `package.json` contains NPM settings for your project. Learn more in the https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules[NPM documentation].
* `.github` contains sample workflow files to use with GitHub Actions.

== Examine the journey files

Inside the `journeys` directory you'll find examples of both browser and lightweight monitors. 

Here's an example of a YAML file defining a *lightweight monitor*:

[source,yml]
----
# lightweight.yml
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  name: Todos Lightweight
  id: todos-lightweight
  urls: "https://elastic.github.io/synthetics-demo/"
  schedule: '@every 1m'
----

For more details on lightweight monitor configuration options,
refer to <<synthetics-lightweight>>.

Here's an example of a TypeScript file defining a *browser monitor*:

[source,ts]
----
//example.journey.ts
import { journey, step, monitor, expect } from '@elastic/synthetics';
journey('My Example Journey', ({ page, params }) => {
  // Only relevant for the push command to create
  // monitors in Kibana
  monitor.use({
    id: 'example-monitor',
    schedule: 10,
  });
  step('launch application', async () => {
    await page.goto(params.url);
  });
  step('assert title', async () => {
    const header = await page.locator('h1');
    expect(await header.textContent()).toBe('todos');
  });
});
----

For more details on writing journeys and configuring browser monitors,
refer to <<synthetics-journeys>>.

== Connect to the {stack}

While inside the project directory you can do two things with the `npx @elastic/synthetics` command:

* Test browser-based monitors locally. To run all journeys defined in `.ts` and `.js` files:
+
[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics journeys
----
* Push all monitor configurations to an Elastic deployment. Run the following command from inside your project:
+
[source,sh]
----
npx @elastic/synthetics push --auth $SYNTHETICS_API_KEY --url <kibana-url>
----

One monitor will appear on the **Monitor management** page for each journey or
lightweight monitor, and you'll manage all monitors from your local environment.
For more details on using the `push` command, refer to <<elastic-synthetics-push-command>>.

[NOTE]
====
If you've <<synthetics-private-location,added a private location>>,
you can `push` to that private location.

To list available private locations,
run the <<elastic-synthetics-locations-command,`elastic-synthetics locations` command>>
with the {kib} URL for the deployment from which to fetch available locations.

== View in {kib}

Then, go to the {uptime-app} in {kib}. You should see your newly pushed monitors running. You can also go to the *Monitor Management* page to see the monitors' configuration settings.

[discrete]
== Recommended workflow

After your project is set up, there are some best practices you can implement to manage project monitors effectively.

First, it's recommended that you version control all files in Git. If your project is not already in a version controlled directory add it now, and push it to your Git host.

While it can be convenient to run the `push` command directly from your workstation,
especially when setting up a new project, it is not recommended for production environments.

Instead, we recommended that you:

1. Develop and test changes locally
2. Create a pull request for all config changes
3. Have your CI service automatically verify the PR by running `npx @elastic/synthetics .`
4. Have a human approve the pull request
5. Merge the pull request
6. Have your CI service automatically deploy the change by running `npx @elastic/synthetics push` after changes are merged

The exact implementation details will depend on the CI system and Git host you use. 
You can reference the sample GitHub configuration file that is included in the `.github`
directory when you create a new project.

// [discrete]
// [[synthetics-ci]]
// === Run on CI

// You can also run a synthetic project on your CI environment. Elastic's synthetics runner can output results in a few different formats, including JSON and JUnit
// (the standard format supported by most CI platforms).

// If any of your journeys fail, the synthetics agent it will yield a non-zero exit code, which most CI systems pick up as a failure by default.

// You can see an example using GitHub Actions in the
// https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/run-synthetics.yml[elastic/synthetics-demo] repository.
// This example sets up a job that executes the synthetics runner and tells the runner to yield results in a JUnit format.
