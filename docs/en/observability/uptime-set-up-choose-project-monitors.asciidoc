== Prerequisites

// tag::prereq[]
To try this beta functionality, first you need to enable Monitor Management in {kib}:

. Go to **{observability}** -> **Uptime**.
. Click **Monitor Management**.
. Review the terms and conditions and click **Enable** to start using Monitor Management.

[IMPORTANT]
======
To enable Monitor Management, you must be logged into {kib} as a user with
the following privileges:

* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster privileges]: `monitor`, `read_ilm`, `read_pipeline`, and at least one of `manage_own_api_key`, `manage_security`, or `manage_api_key`
* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges] for `synthetics-*`: `view_index_metadata`, `create_doc`, `auto_configure`
======

You should also decide where you want to run the monitors before getting started:

* *Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure*:
  With Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure, you can create and run monitors in multiple
  locations without having to manage your own infrastructure.
  Elastic takes care of software updates and capacity planning for you.
* *Private locations*: Private locations allow you to run monitors from your own premises.
  To use private locations will must create a private location before continuing.
  For step-by-step instructions, refer to <<synthetics-private-location>>.

== Add monitors

To use a YAML file and the Elastic Synthetics library to add a
lightweight monitor on Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure:

. You'll need a project using `@elastic/synthetics`. You can use an existing project where you manage browser monitors, or you can create a new project using `elastic-synthetics init`.
. Add one or more `.yml` files to the project.
. Configure monitors in the `.yml` files. For example:

```yml
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  id: elastic-http
  name: Elastic HTTP check
  urls: ["https://elastic.co"]
  schedule: "@every 60s"
  tags: ["org:elastic"]
- type: tcp
  id: elastic-tcp
  name: Elastic TCP check
  hosts: ["elastic.co"]
  schedule: "@every 60s"
  tags: ["org:elastic"]
```

[IMPORTANT]
====
*This functionality is still in beta and not all {heartbeat} configuration options are supported.* If you attempt to push a project monitor with a configuration option that is not supported, the push will fail with an error.
