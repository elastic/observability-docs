[[apm-error-count-threshold-rule]]
= Error count threshold rule

Alert when the number of errors in a service exceeds a defined threshold. Error count rules can be set at the
environment level, service level, and error group level.

== Filters and conditions

Filter the errors coming from your application to apply an Error count threshold rule to a specific
service (`SERVICE`), environment (`ENVIRONMENT`) or error grouping key (`ERROR GROUPING KEY`).
Alternatively, you can use a {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[KQL filter] to limit the scope of the alert
by toggling on the *Use KQL Filter* option.

[TIP]
====
Similar errors are grouped together to make it easy to quickly see which errors are affecting your services and to take actions to rectify them. Each group of errors has a unique _error grouping key_ â€” a hash of the stack trace and other properties.
====

Then, you can specify which conditions should result in an alert. This includes specifying:

* The number of errors that occurred (`IS ABOVE`).
* The timeframe in which the errors must occur (`FOR THE LAST`) in seconds, minutes, hours, or days.

.Example
****
This example creates a rule for all production services that would result in an alert when there are 25 errors
in the last five minutes:

Alternatively, you can use a KQL filter to limit the scope of the alert:

. Toggle on *Use KQL Filter*.
. Add a filter:

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in integrations.

=== Action variables

A default message is provided as a starting point for your alert.
If you want to customize the message, add more context to the message by clicking the icon above
the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.

TIP: To add variables to alert messages, use https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template syntax, for example `{{variable.name}}`.
