= Quickstart: Unified Kubernetes Observability with Elastic Distributions of OpenTelemetry (EDOT)

preview::[]

In this quickstart guide, you will learn how to send Kubernetes logs, metrics, and application traces to Elasticsearch, using the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/[OpenTelemetry Operator] to orchestrate https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry/tree/main[Elastic Distributions of OpenTelemetry] (EDOT) Collectors and SDK instances.

All the components will be deployed through the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-kube-stack[opentelemetry-kube-stack] helm chart. They include:

* https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/[OpenTelemetry Operator].
* `DaemonSet` EDOT Collector configured for node level metrics.
* `Deployment` EDOT Collector configured for cluster level metrics.
* `Instrumentation` object for applications https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/[auto-instrumentation].

For a more detailed description of the components and advanced configuration refer to the https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry/blob/main/docs/kubernetes/operator/README.md[elastic/opentelemetry] GitHub repository.

== Prerequisites

* A deployment using our hosted {ess} on {ess-trial}[{ecloud}]. The deployment includes an {es} cluster for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing your data.
* A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.23 or newer).
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/[Kubectl].
* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm].
* (optional) https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/[Cert-manager], if you opt for automatic generation and renewal of TLS certificates.

[discrete]
== Collect your data

.  In {kib}, go to **Observability** and click **Add Data**.

. Under the question *`What do you want to monitor?`* select **Kubernetes**, and then select the **OpenTelemetry: Full Observability** option.

. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the installation of all needed components.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default installation deploys the OpenTelemetry Operator with a self-signed TLS certificate valid for 365 days. This certificate **won't be renewed** unless the Helm Chart release is manually updated. Refer to the https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry/blob/main/docs/kubernetes/operator/README.md#cert-manager[cert-manager integrated installation] guide to enable automatic certificate generation and renewal using https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/[cert-manager].
====
+
Install the OpenTelemetry Operator using the kube-stack Helm chart and the provided values file. You will run a few commands to:
+ 
 * Add the helm chart repository needed for the installation.
 * Create a namespace.
 * Create a secret with an API Key and the {es} endpoint to be used by the collectors.
 * Deploy the `opentelemetry-kube-stack` helm chart with the provided `values.yaml`.

== Visualize your data

After installation is complete and all relevant data is flowing into Elastic,
the **Visualize your data** section provides a link to the *[OTEL][Metrics Kubernetes]Cluster Overview* dashboard used to monitor the health of the cluster.
