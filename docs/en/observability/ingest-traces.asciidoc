This guide describes how to:

* Collect Application Performance Monitoring (APM) data
* Send APM data to the {stack}
* Explore and visualize the data in real-time

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {forum}[discuss forum].

[[fleet-prereqs-traces]]
== Prerequisites

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud}
(recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.

Here's what you need for each deployment type:

[[set-up-fleet-traces]]
== Step 1: Set up {fleet}

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get APM data into the {stack}.

The first time you use {fleet}, you might need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::../ingest-management/tab-widgets/add-fleet-server/widget.asciidoc[]

For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[{fleet-server}].

NOTE: The APM integration does not support running {agent} in standalone mode;
you must use {fleet} to manage {agent}.

[discrete]
[[add-apm-integration]]
== Step 2: Add the APM integration

Next, add the APM integration to the default policy used by your {agent}.
Policies manage settings across a group of {agent}s and may contain any number of integrations
for collecting observability data from the various services running on your host.

include::./tab-widgets/add-apm-integration/widget.asciidoc[]

[[add-agent-to-fleet-traces]]
== Step 3: Install and run an {agent} on your machine

****
This step is optional for {ess} users as {ecloud} spins up an {agent} instance automatically.
Unless you want to run a separate {agent} on an edge machine, {ess} users should skip this step.
****

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query
data from operating systems, and more. A single agent makes it easy and fast to
deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy (a
collection of input settings) that you can update to add integrations for new
data sources, security protections, and more.

Don't confuse {agent} with APM agents–they are different components.
In a later step, you'll instrument your code with APM agents and send the data
to an APM Server instance that {agent} spins up.

If you plan on enabling Real User Monitoring (RUM), you must run {agent} centrally.
If RUM is disabled, you should run {agent} on edge machines.

To send APM data to the {stack}:

include::../ingest-management/elastic-agent/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.asciidoc[tag=agent-enroll]

[[add-apm-integration-agents]]
== Step 4: Install APM agents

APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each {apm-agent}'s configuration–
to the index that its data is stored in {es}.
Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for {apm-agent} and APM Server communication.
This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.

TIP: You can edit your APM integration settings if you need to change the APM Server URL
or secret token to match your APM agents.

[[view-apm-integration-data]]
== Step 5: View your data

Back in {kib}, under {observability}, select APM.
You should see application performance monitoring data flowing into the {stack}!

NOTE: The built-in `apm_user` role is not compatible with the APM integration
as it only provides read access to `apm-*` indices.
For a list of indices users need access to, refer to
{apm-guide-ref}/apm-data-streams.html[APM data streams]

== What's next?

* Now that data is streaming into the {stack}, take your investigation to a
deeper level! Use https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic {observability}]
to unify your logs, metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
https://www.elastic.co/security[{elastic-sec}]. Adding endpoint protection is
just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
{observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Create alerts] and find out about
problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use {ml} to
{observability-guide}/inspect-log-anomalies.html[detect anomalies].

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
other hosts by deploying {agent}s across your infrastructure!
