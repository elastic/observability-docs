This guide describes how to:

* Collect Application Performance Monitoring (APM) data
* Send APM data to the {stack}
* Explore and visualize the data in real-time

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {forum}[discuss forum].

[[fleet-prereqs-traces]]
== Prerequisites

* You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our
{ess-product}[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud} (recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.
+
Here's what you need for each deployment type:
+
--
include::{tab-widgets}/prereq-widget.asciidoc[]
--

* An internet connection is required for {kib} to download integration packages
from the Elastic Package Registry. Make sure the {kib} server can connect to
`https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`.

* {fleet} is currently only available to users with the
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[superuser role].

[[set-up-fleet-traces]]
== Step 1: Set up {fleet}

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get APM data into the {stack}.

The first time you use {fleet}, you might need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{tab-widgets}/add-fleet-server/widget.asciidoc[]

For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[{fleet-server}].

[[add-agent-to-fleet-traces]]
== Step 2: Add an {agent} to {fleet}

[TIP]
====
Don't confuse {agent} with APM agents–they are different components.
In a later step, you'll instrument your code with APM agents and send the data
to an APM Server instance that {agent} spins up.
====

{agent} is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.

If you plan on enabling Real User Monitoring (RUM), you must run {agent} centrally.
If RUM is disabled, you should run {agent} on edge machines.

To send APM data to the {stack}:

include::{fleet-repo-dir}/elastic-agent/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.asciidoc[tag=agent-enroll]

[[add-apm-integration]]
== Step 3: Add the APM integration

Next, you'll browse a catalog of integrations, then add an APM integration to
the default policy used by your agent. You use policies to manage settings
across a group of agents. An agent policy may contain any number of integrations
for collecting observability data from the various services running on your
host.

. In {kib}, select **Add integrations**.

. Click the **Elastic APM** integration to see more details about it, then click
**Add Elastic APM**.
+

image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-apm-overview.png[{fleet} showing APM integration overview]

. On the **Add Elastic APM integration** page,
define the host and port where APM Server will listen.
If you're using our hosted **Elastic Cloud** offering, the URL where APM Server listens will be predefined.
Inspect or change other settings.

. Under **Apply to agent policy**, select the default policy.
Click **Save and continue**.
+
****
In this guide, you add integrations to the default policy created by
{kib}. After you learn the basics, you can create your own policies and assign
them to agents.

. To see the updated policy, click the *Default policy* link.
+
The newly added APM integration should appear under **Fleet** > **Agent policies** > **Default policy**,
along with the default System integration.
+

All {agent}s that use this policy will collect APM data from your instrumented services.

[[add-apm-integration-agents]]
== Step 4: Install APM agents

APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each APM agent's configuration–
to the index that its data is stored in {es}.
Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for APM agent and APM Server communication.
This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.

TIP: You can edit your APM integration settings if you need to change the APM Server URL
or secret token to match your APM agents.

[[view-apm-integration-data]]
== Step 5: View your data

Back in {kib}, under Observability, select APM.
You should see application performance monitoring data flowing into the {stack}!

NOTE: The built-in `apm_user` role is not compatible with the APM integration
as it only provides read access to `apm-*` indices.
For a list of indices users need access to, refer to
{apm-guide-ref}/apm-data-streams.html[APM data streams]

== What's next?

* Now that data is streaming into the {stack}, take your investigation to a
deeper level! Use https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic {observability}]
to unify your logs, metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
https://www.elastic.co/security[{elastic-sec}]. Adding endpoint protection is
just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
{observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Create alerts] and find out about
problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use machine learning to
{observability-guide}/inspect-log-anomalies.html[detect anomalies].

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
other hosts by deploying {agent}s across your infrastructure!
