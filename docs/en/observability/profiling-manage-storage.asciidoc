= Manage Storage

Universal Profiling uses lifecycle management to automatically age data. It ships with a default index lifecycle policy but it is possible to customize the index lifecycle to your requirements. With <<profiling-probabilistic-profiling, probabilistic profiling>> it is possible to configure the Universal Profiling agent to run in probabilistic profiling mode and reduce storage even further.
