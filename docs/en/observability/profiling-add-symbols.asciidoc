= Add symbols for native frames

beta::[]

To see function names and line numbers in traces of applications written in programming languages that 
compile to native code (C, C++, Rust, Go, etc.), you need to push symbols to the cluster using the `symbtool` CLI utility.

[[profiling-download-symbtool]]
== Download the `symbtool` binary

Click the appropriate link for your system to download the `symbtool` binary:

 * https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/prodfiler/symbtool-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz[x86_64] 
 * https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/prodfiler/symbtool-{version}-linux-arm64.tar.gz[ARM64]


NOTE: The `symbtool` binary currently requires a Linux machine.

[[profiling-use-symbtool]]
== Use the `symbtool` binary


Before using the `symbtool` binary, create an {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html#create-api-key[Elasticsearch API token]. 
Pass this token using the `-t` or `--api-key` argument.


You also need to copy the *Symbols* endpoint from the deployment overview page. Pass this URL using the `-u` or `--url` argument.

[[profiling-symbols-c]]
== Custom C, C++, Go and Rust applications
C/C++ applications must be built with debug symbols (`-g`) for symbolization to work. Rust applications
must be built with https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug[`debug = 1`] (or higher). 
Go binaries will not require any special compiler flags and come with debug information by default. The debug 
info doesn't have to be deployed to production, but it does have to be present temporarily to push it to the 
Elastic cluster.

If you don't mind deploying your applications with debug symbols, run:

[source,bash]
----
./symbtool push-symbols executable -e ./my-app -u <symbolizer url> -t <API token>
----

If you don't want debug symbols in production, copy the executable and strip the copy.
You can then use the `-d` argument to instruct the tool to read the symbols from the original
unstripped binary while still calculating the file ID from the final stripped binary. After
the symbols have been pushed, you can remove the unstripped binary:

[source,bash]
----
cp ./my-app ./my-stripped-app
strip ./my-stripped-app
./symbtool push-symbols executable -e ./my-stripped-app -d ./my-app -u <symbolizer url> -t <API token>
rm ./my-app
----

WARNING: Pushing debug information and then stripping the binary later **does not work**.
The executable passed using the `-e` argument is used to calculate the file ID that associates stack 
traces with their symbols and stripping the binary later changes that ID.

== Linux distribution packages

Elastic hosts a public service with symbol information for all packages in the repositories
for various popular Linux distributions. Applications installed from these repositories are automatically symbolized without any action required on the user's side.


Elastic supports the following Linux distributions:


- Alpine Linux
- Amazon Linux
- Debian
- Fedora
- Ubuntu
