In addition to exploring visualizations in the Applications UI in {kib}, you can make your application data
more actionable with:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| <<apm-alerts,Rules and alerts>>
| The Applications UI allows you to define rules to detect complex
  conditions within your APM data and trigger built-in actions when those conditions are met.

| <<apm-custom-links,Custom links>>
| Build URLs that contain relevant metadata from a specific trace.
  For example, you can create a link that will take you to a page where you can open a new GitHub issue
  with context already auto-populated in the issue body.
  These links will be shown in the _Actions_ context menu in selected areas of the Applications UI (for example, by transaction details).
