In addition to exploring visualizations in the APM UI in {kib}, you can make your application data
more actionable with:

* <<apm-alerts,*Alerts and rules*>>: The APM UI allows you to define rules to detect complex
  conditions within your APM data and trigger built-in actions when those conditions are met.
* <<apm-custom-links,*Custom links*>>: Build URLs that contain relevant metadata from a specific
  trace. For example, you can create a link that creates a new GitHub issue with context in the
  auto-populated in the issue body. These links will be shown in the _Actions_ context menu in
  selected areas of the APM UI (for example, by transaction details).
