== Secure communication with APM agents

<titleabbrev>With APM agents</titleabbrev>
++++

Communication between APM agents and {agent} can be both encrypted and authenticated.
It is strongly recommended to use both TLS encryption and authentication as secrets are sent as plain text.

* <<apm-agent-tls,TLS encryption>>
* <<apm-api-key,API key authentication>>
* <<apm-secret-token,Secret token authentication>>

As soon as an authenticated communication is enabled,
requests without a valid token or API key will be denied.
If both API keys and a secret token are enabled, APM agents can choose whichever mechanism they support.

In some use-cases, like when an {apm-agent} is running on the client side,
authentication is not possible. See <<apm-anonymous-auth>> for more information.
