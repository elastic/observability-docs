== Language-specific options

Use Elastic APM agents or an OpenTelemetry language SDK to instrument a service in the language its written in:

* <<apm-agents,*Elastic APM agents*>>: Elastic APM agents are instrumentation libraries written in the same language as your service.
* <<apm-open-telemetry,*OpenTelemetry*>>: OpenTelemetry is an open source set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of telemetry data from your services and applications.
** This option includes Elastic Distributions of OpenTelemetry, which are customized versions of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[OpenTelemetry language SDKs] that are optimized to work with an Elastic backend.

*Not sure which method is right for you?* Compare the available options below.

== Service-specific options

Elastic also offers several tools to help you collect data from specific services:

* *Kubernetes*: The Elastic APM attacher for Kubernetes simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods.
  Read more in the {apm-attacher-ref}/apm-attacher.html[APM attacher for Kubernetes docs].
* *AWS Lambda Functions*: Helps you monitor your AWS Lambda functions.
  Read more in the {apm-lambda-ref}/aws-lambda-arch.html[APM Architecture for AWS Lambda docs].
* deprecated:[8.15.0] *Jaeger*: Helps you to switch an existing Jaeger setup from the default
  Jaeger backend to the {stack}. Read more in <<apm-jaeger-integration,Integrate with Jaeger>>.
