Lifecycle policies allow you to automate the lifecycle of your APM indices as they grow and age.
A default policy is applied to each APM data stream, but can be customized depending on your business needs.

[id="index-lifecycle-policies-default{append-legacy}"]
== Default policies

[NOTE]
====
// Explain what changed
// Before
Before 8.15, clusters used {ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[index lifecycle management (ILM)] to provide the default data retention settings for APM data.
// After
As of 8.15, new clusters use {ref}/data-stream-lifecycle.html[data stream lifecycle (DSL)] to provide default data retention settings, but the customization for lifecycle is still performed using ILM policies, which are now configured to override the default DSL polices.

// What this means for existing clusters that are upgraded
For _existing_ clusters upgrading to 8.15, the default ILM policies should still work as expected.
You can can continue using ILM or switch the default to DSL explicitly using the {ref}/data-stream-apis.html[data stream API].

// What this means for new clusters that are created
For _new_ clusters created in 8.15 or later, if you prefer to continue using ILM,
follow the steps in this guide to create a custom ILM policy and add it to the `*@custom` component template for each data stream.

Each APM data stream has its own default lifecycle policy including a delete definition and a rollover definition.

The table below describes the delete definition for each APM data stream.
The delete phase permanently removes the index after a time threshold is met.

Rollover (writing to a new index) prevents a single index from growing too large and optimizes indexing and search performance.
Rollover occurs after either an age or size metric is met.
The default rollover definition for each APM data stream is applied based on {ref}/data-stream-lifecycle-settings.html#cluster-lifecycle-default-rollover[`cluster.lifecycle.default.rollover`].

The APM data stream lifecycle policies can be viewed in {kib}:

. To open **Index Management**, find **Stack Management** in the main menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field].
. Select **Component Templates**.
. Search for `apm`.
. Look for templates with `@lifecycle` suffix.

TIP: Default lifecycle policies can change between minor versions. This is not considered a breaking change as index management should continually improve and adapt to new features.

== Configure a custom index lifecycle policy

Mappings and settings for data streams can be customized through the creation of `*@custom` component templates,
which are referenced by the index templates created by the {es} apm-data plugin.
The easiest way to configure a custom index lifecycle policy per data stream is to edit this template.

This tutorial explains how to apply a custom index lifecycle policy to the `traces-apm` data stream.

[discrete]
[id="apm-data-streams-custom-one{append-legacy}"]
== Step 1: View data streams

The **Data Streams** view in {kib} shows you data streams,
index templates, and lifecycle policies:

. To open **Index Management**, find **Stack Management** in the main menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field].
. Select **Data Streams**.
. Search for `traces-apm` to see all data streams associated with APM trace data.
. In this example, I only have one data stream because I'm only using the `default` namespace.
You may have more if your setup includes multiple namespaces.

[id="apm-data-streams-custom-two{append-legacy}"]
== Step 2: Create an index lifecycle policy

. To open **Lifecycle Policies**, find **Stack Management** in the main menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field].
. Click **Create policy**.

Name your new policy; For this tutorial, I've chosen `custom-traces-apm-policy`.
Customize the policy to your liking, and when you're done, click **Save policy**.

[id="apm-data-streams-custom-three{append-legacy}"]
== Step 3: Apply the index lifecycle policy

To apply your new index lifecycle policy to the `traces-apm-*` data stream,
edit the `<data-stream-name>@custom` component template.

. Click on the **Component Template** tab and search for `traces-apm`.
. Select the `traces-apm@custom` template and click **Manage** â†’ **Edit**.
. Under **Index settings**, set the {ilm-init} policy name created in the previous step:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "name": "custom-traces-apm-policy",
    "prefer_ilm": true
  }
}
----
. Continue to **Review** and ensure your request looks similar to the image below.
If it does, click **Create component template**.

[id="apm-data-streams-custom-four{append-legacy}"]
== Step 4: Roll over the data stream (optional)

To confirm that the data stream is now using the new index template and {ilm-init} policy,
you can either repeat <<apm-data-streams-custom-one,step one>>, or navigate to **{dev-tools-app}** and run the following:

[source,bash]
----
GET /_data_stream/traces-apm-default <1>
----
<1> The name of the data stream we've been hacking on appended with your <namespace>

The result should include the following:

[source,json]
----
{
  "data_streams" : [
    {
      ...
      "template" : "traces-apm-default", <1>
      "ilm_policy" : "custom-traces-apm-policy", <2>
      ...
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> The name of the custom index template created in step three
<2> The name of the {ilm-init} policy applied to the new component template in step two

New {ilm-init} policies only take effect when new indices are created,
so you either must wait for a rollover to occur (usually after 30 days or when the index size reaches 50 GB),
or force a rollover using the {ref}/indices-rollover-index.html[{es} rollover API]:

[source,bash]
----
POST /traces-apm-default/_rollover/
----

[id="apm-data-streams-custom-policy-namespace{append-legacy}"]
== Namespace-level index lifecycle policies

It is also possible to create more granular index lifecycle policies that apply to individual namespaces.
This process is similar to the above tutorial, but includes cloning and modify the existing index template to use
a new `*@custom` component template.
