=== Logging integration

Elastic APM integrates with popular logging frameworks, making it easy to correlate your logs and traces.
This enables you to:

- view the context of a log and the parameters provided by a user
- view all logs belonging to a particular trace
- easily move between logs and traces when debugging application issues

See the <<application-logs>> guide to get started.
