=== Upgrade to version {version}

This guide explains the upgrade process for version {version}.
For a detailed look at what's new, see:

* {observability-guide}/whats-new.html[What's new in {observability}]
* {kibana-ref}/whats-new.html[What's new in {kib}]
* {ref}/release-highlights.html[{es} release highlights]

=== Notable APM changes

* All index management has been removed from APM Server;
the built-in {es} apm-data plugin is entirely responsible for setting up index templates, index lifecycle polices,
and index pipelines.
* APM Server now only writes to well-defined data streams;
writing to classic indices is no longer supported.
* APM Server has a new {es} output implementation with defaults that should be sufficient for
most use cases.

As a result of the above changes,
a number of index management and index tuning configuration variables have been removed.
See the APM <<apm-release-notes,release notes>>, <<apm-breaking,breaking changes>> for full details.
