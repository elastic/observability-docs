= Use APM securely

When setting up Elastic APM, it's critical to ensure that application data is secure from start to finish.
You should approach securing your application data from different perspectives:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| *What kind of data is collected?*
| Ensure that data doesn’t contain sensitive information like passwords,
  credit card numbers, health data, or other identifiable information.

  Read more in <<apm-data-security>>.

| *How do APM agents and {agent} communicate?*
| Ensure that any communication between APM agents and {agent}
  are both encrypted and authenticated.

  Read more in <<apm-secure-agent-communication>>.

| *How do APM Server and the {stack} communicate?*
| Use role-based access control to grant APM Server users access
  to secured resources. The roles that you set up depend on your organization's security requirements and the
  minimum privileges required to use specific features.

  Read more in <<apm-secure-comms-stack>>.

| *Who can use the APM UI?*
| Use role-based access control to grant users access to features of the APM UI.
