== Upgrading to v8.15.x may cause ingestion to fail

_Elastic Stack versions: 8.15.0+_
    
// The conditions in which this issue occurs
The issue only occurs when _upgrading_ the {stack} from 8.12.2 or lower directly to any 8.15.x version.
The issue does _not_ occur when creating a _new_ cluster using any 8.15.x version, or when upgrading
from 8.12.2 to 8.13.x or 8.14.x and then to 8.15.x.

// Describe why it happens
In APM Servers versions prior to 8.13.0, an ingestion pipeline exists to perform a check on the version.
The version check would fail any APM document produced with a different version of APM server compared to the version of the installed APM’s ingest pipeline.
In 8.13.0 the version check in the ingest pipeline was removed.
Due to the combination of an internal change in how apm data management assets are set up from 8.15 onwards and a bug in Elasticsearch, 
related to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/112781[lazy rollover of data streams], the ingestion pipeline conducting the version check is not removed on upgrade and prevents the ingestion of data.

// How to fix it
If the deployment is running 8.15.0, upgrade the deployment to 8.15.1 or above.
A manual rollover of all APM data streams is required to pick up the new index templates and remove the faulty ingest pipeline version check.
Perform the following requests to Elasticsearch (they are assuming the `default` namespace is used, adjust if necessary):

== Upgrading to v8.15.0 may cause APM indices to lose their lifecycle policy

_Elastic Stack versions: 8.15.0_ +
_Fixed in Elastic Stack version 8.15.1_

// The conditions in which this issue occurs
The issue only occurs when _upgrading_ the {stack} to 8.15.0.
The issue does _not_ occur when creating a _new_ cluster using 8.15.0.
The issue also does not occur if a custom ILM policy is configured using a custom component template.

// Describe why it happens
In 8.15.0, APM Server switched to use data stream lifecycle to manage data retention
for APM indices for new deployments as well as for upgraded deployments with default lifecycle
configurations. Unfortunately, since any data stream created before 8.15.0 does not have a data
stream lifecycle configuration, such existing data streams become unmanaged for default
lifecycle configurations.

// How to fix it
Upgrading to 8.15.1 should fix any new indices created for the data stream. However,
indices created in version 8.15.0 would remain unmanaged if the default ILM policy is
used. One of the following approaches can be adopted to fix the unmanaged indices:

. Manually delete the indices when they are no longer needed.
. Explicitly configure APM data streams with the default data stream lifecycle config
for the data streams configured to use default ILM policies. Using this approach would
migrate all affected data streams to use data stream lifecycles, which should be equivalent
to the default ILM policies. Note that the fix should be applied only to data streams that
are resulting in unmanaged indices due to default ILM policies.

== Upgrading to v8.13.0 to v8.13.2 breaks APM anomaly rules

_Elastic Stack versions: 8.13.0, 8.13.1, 8.13.2_ +
_Fixed in Elastic Stack version 8.13.3_

// The conditions in which this issue occurs
This issue occurs when upgrading the Elastic Stack to version 8.13.0, 8.13.1, or 8.13.2.
This issue may go unnoticed unless you actively monitor your {kib} logs.
The following log indicates the presence of this issue:
[source,shell]
----
"params invalid: [anomalyDetectorTypes]: expected value of type [array] but got [undefined]"
----

This issue occurs because a non-optional parameter, `anomalyDetectorTypes` was added in 8.13.0 without
the presence of an automation migration script. This breaks pre-existing rules as they do not have this parameter
and will fail validation. This issue is fixed in v8.13.3.

There are three ways to fix this error:

* Upgrade to version 8.13.3
* Fix broken anomaly rules in the APM UI (no upgrade required)
* Fix broken anomaly rules with Kibana APIs (no upgrade required)

**Fix broken anomaly rules in the APM UI**

. From any APM page in Kibana, select **Alerts and rules** -> **Manage rules**.
. Filter your rules by setting **Type** to **APM Anomaly**.
. For each anomaly rule in the list, select the pencil icon to edit the rule.
. Add one or more **DETECTOR TYPES** to the rule.
+
The detector type determines when the anomaly rule triggers. For example, a latency anomaly rule will
trigger when the latency of the service being monitored is abnormal.
Supported detector types are `latency`, `throughput`, and `failed transaction rate`.
. Click **Save**.

**Fix broken anomaly rules with Kibana APIs**

. Find broken rules
+
====
To identify rules in this exact state, you can use the {kibana-ref}/find-rules-api.html[find rules endpoint] and search for the APM anomaly rule type as well as this exact error message indicating that the rule is in the broken state. We will also use the `fields` parameter to specify only the fields required when making the update request later.

* `search_fields=alertTypeId`
* `search=apm.anomaly`
* `filter=alert.attributes.executionStatus.error.message:"params invalid: [anomalyDetectorTypes]: expected value of type [array] but got [undefined]"`
* `fields=[id, name, actions, tags, schedule, notify_when, throttle, params]`

The encoded request might look something like this:

[source,shell]
----
curl -u "$KIBANA_USER":"$KIBANA_PASSWORD" "$KIBANA_URL/api/alerting/rules/_find?search_fields=alertTypeId&search=apm.anomaly&filter=alert.attributes.executionStatus.error.message%3A%22params%20invalid%3A%20%5BanomalyDetectorTypes%5D%3A%20expected%20value%20of%20type%20%5Barray%5D%20but%20got%20%5Bundefined%5D%22&fields=id&fields=name&fields=actions&fields=tags&fields=schedule&fields=notify_when&fields=throttle&fields=params"

====

. Prepare the update JSON doc(s)
+
====
For each broken rule found, create a JSON rule document with what was returned from the API in the previous step. You will need to make two changes to each document:

. Remove the `id` key but keep the value connected to this document (e.g. rename the file to `{id}.json`). **The `id` cannot be sent as part of the request body for the PUT request, but you will need it for the URL path.**
. Add the `"anomalyDetectorTypes"` to the `"params"` block, using the default value as seen below to mimic the pre-8.13 behavior:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "params": {
    // ... other existing params should stay here,
    // with the required one added to this object
    "anomalyDetectorTypes": [
      "txLatency",
      "txThroughput",
      "txFailureRate"
    ]
  }
}
----
====

. Update each rule using the `PUT /api/alerting/rule/{id}` API
+
====
For each rule, submit a PUT request to the {kibana-ref}/update-rule-api.html[update rule endpoint] using that rule's ID and its stored update document from the previous step. For example, assuming the first broken rule's ID is `046c0d4f`:

[source,shell]
----
curl -u "$KIBANA_USER":"$KIBANA_PASSWORD" -XPUT "$KIBANA_URL/api/alerting/rule/046c0d4f" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'kbn-xsrf: rule-update' -d @046c0d4f.json
----

Once the PUT request executes successfully, the rule will no longer be broken.

[[apm-empty-metricset-values]]
== Upgrading APM Server to 8.11+ might break event intake from older APM Java agents

_APM Server versions: >=8.11.0_ +
_Elastic APM Java agent versions: < 1.43.0_

// Describe the conditions in which this issue occurs
If you are using APM Server (> v8.11.0) and the Elastic APM Java agent (< v1.43.0),
// Describe the behavior of the issue
the agent may be sending empty histogram metricsets.

// Describe why it happens
In previous APM Server versions some data validation was not properly applied,
leading the APM Server to accept empty histogram metricsets where it shouldn't.
This bug was fixed in the APM Server in 8.11.0.

The APM Java agent (< v1.43.0) was sending this kind of invalid data under certain circumstances.
If you upgrade the APM Server to v8.11.0+ _without_ upgrading the APM Java agent version,
metricsets can be rejected by the APM Server and can result in additional error logs in the Java agent.

// Include exact error messages linked to this issue
// so users searching for the error message end up here.

// Link to fix
The fix is to upgrade the Elastic APM Java agent to a version >= 1.43.0.
Find details in https://github.com/elastic/apm-data/pull/157[elastic/apm-data#157].

== traces-apm@custom ingest pipeline applied to certain data streams unintentionally

_APM Server versions: 8.12.0_ +

// Describe the conditions in which this issue occurs
If you're using the Elastic APM Server v8.12.0,
// Describe the behavior of the issue
the `traces-apm@custom` ingest pipeline is now additionally applied to data streams `traces-apm.sampled-*`
and `traces-apm.rum-*`, and applied twice for `traces-apm-*`. This bug impacts users with a non-empty `traces-apm@custom` ingest pipeline.

If you rely on this unintended behavior in 8.12.0, please rename your pipeline to `traces-apm.integration@custom` to preserve this behavior in later versions.

// Describe why it happens
// This happens because...

// Include exact error messages linked to this issue
// so users searching for the error message end up here.

== Ingesting new JVM metrics in 8.9 and 8.10 breaks upgrade to 8.11 and stops ingestion

_APM Server versions: 8.11.0, 8.11.1_ +
_Elastic APM Java agent versions: 1.39.0+_

// Describe the conditions in which this issue occurs
If you're using the Elastic APM Java agent v1.39.0+ to send new JVM metrics to APM Server v8.9.x and v8.10.x,
// Describe the behavior of the issue
upgrading to 8.11.0 or 8.11.1 will silently fail and stop ingesting APM metrics.
// Describe why it happens
// This happens because...

// Include exact error messages linked to this issue
// so users searching for the error message end up here.
After upgrading, you will see the following errors:

* APM Server error logs:

== APM integration package upgrade through Fleet causes excessive data stream rollovers

_APM Server versions: \<= 8.12.1 +_

// Describe the conditions in which this issue occurs
If you're upgrading APM integration package to any versions \<= 8.12.1,
// Describe the behavior of the issue
in some rare cases, the upgrade fails with a mapping conflict error. The upgrade process keeps rolling
over the data stream in an unsuccessful attempt to work around the error. As a result, many empty backing indices for
APM data streams are created.
// Describe why it happens
// This happens because...

== Performance regression: APM issues too many small bulk requests for Elasticsearch output

_APM Server versions: >=8.13.0, \<= 8.14.2_ +

// Describe the conditions in which this issue occurs
If you're on APM server version >=8.13.0, \<= 8.14.2_, using Elasticsearch output,
do not specify any `output.elasticsearch.flush_bytes`,
and do not disable compression explicitly by setting `output.elasticsearch.compression_level` to `0`,
// Describe the behavior of the issue
APM server will issue smaller bulk requests of 24KB size,
and more bulk requests will need to be made to maintain the original throughput.
This causes Elasticsearch to experience higher load,
and APM server may exhibit Elasticsearch backpressure symptoms.

// Describe why it happens
This happens because a performance regression was introduced, such that the default value of bulk indexer flush bytes
was reduced from 1MB to 24KB.

Affected APM servers will emit the following log:

[source,txt]
----
flush_bytes config value is too small (0) and might be ignored by the indexer, increasing value to 24576
----

To workaround the issue, modify the Elasticsearch output configuration in APM.

* For APM Server binary
** In `apm-server.yml`, set `output.elasticsearch.flush_bytes: 1mib`
* For Fleet-managed APM (non-Elastic Cloud)
** In Fleet, open the Settings tab.
** Under Outputs, identify the Elasticsearch output that receives from APM, select the edit icon.
** In the Edit output flyout, in "Advanced YAML configuration" field, add line `flush_bytes: 1mib`.
* For Elastic Cloud
** It is not possible to edit the Fleet "Elastic Cloud internal output".

// Link to fix
A fix will be released in 8.14.3: https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/13576[elastic/apm-server#13576].
