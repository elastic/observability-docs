Output configuration options.

// You configure APM Server to write to a specific output by setting options
// in the Outputs section of the +apm-server.yml+ config file. Only a single
// output may be defined.

// The following topics describe how to configure each supported output. If you've
// secured the {stack}, also read <<securing-apm-server>> for more about
// security-related configuration options.

[[apm-sourcemap-output]]

[float]
== Source maps

Source maps can be uploaded through all outputs but must eventually be stored in {es}.
When using outputs other than {es}, `source_mapping.elasticsearch` must be set for source maps to be applied.
Be sure to update `source_mapping.index_pattern` if source maps are stored in the non-default location.
See <<apm-config-sourcemapping-elasticsearch>> for more details.
