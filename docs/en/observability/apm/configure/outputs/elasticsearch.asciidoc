This documentation only applies to APM Server binary users.
Fleet-managed users should see {fleet-guide}/elasticsearch-output.html[Configure the {es} output].
****

The {es} output sends events directly to {es} using the {es} HTTP API.

Example configuration:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"] <1>
----
<1> To enable SSL, add `https` to all URLs defined under __hosts__.

When sending data to a secured cluster through the `elasticsearch`
output, APM Server can use any of the following authentication methods:

* Basic authentication credentials (username and password).
* Token-based (API key) authentication.
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates.

*Basic authentication:*

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
  username: "apm_writer"
  password: "{pwd}"
----

*API key authentication:*

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
  api_key: "ZCV7VnwBgnX0T19fN8Qe:KnR6yE41RrSowb0kQ0HWoA"
----

*PKI certificate authentication:*

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
  ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
  ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
----

See <<apm-securing-communication-elasticsearch>> for details on each authentication method.

[float]
=== Compatibility

This output works with all compatible versions of {es}. See the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_compatibility[Elastic Support
Matrix].

[float]
=== Configuration options

You can specify the following options in the `elasticsearch` section of the +apm-server.yml+ config file:

[float]
==== `enabled`

The enabled config is a boolean setting to enable or disable the output. If set
to `false`, the output is disabled.

The default value is `true`.

[float]
[[apm-hosts-option]]
==== `hosts`

The list of {es} nodes to connect to. The events are distributed to
these nodes in round robin order. If one node becomes unreachable, the event is
automatically sent to another node. Each {es} node can be defined as a `URL` or `IP:PORT`.
For example: `http://192.15.3.2`, `https://es.found.io:9230` or `192.24.3.2:9300`.
If no port is specified, `9200` is used.

NOTE: When a node is defined as an `IP:PORT`, the _scheme_ and _path_ are taken from the
<<apm-protocol-option,`protocol`>> and <<apm-path-option,`path`>> config options.

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["10.45.3.2:9220", "10.45.3.1:9230"] <1>
  protocol: https
  path: /elasticsearch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous example, the {es} nodes are available at `https://10.45.3.2:9220/elasticsearch` and
`https://10.45.3.1:9230/elasticsearch`.

[float]
==== `compression_level`

The gzip compression level. Setting this value to `0` disables compression.
The compression level must be in the range of `1` (best speed) to `9` (best compression).

Increasing the compression level will reduce the network usage but will increase the CPU usage.

The default value is `0`.

[float]
==== `escape_html`

Configure escaping of HTML in strings. Set to `true` to enable escaping.

The default value is `false`.

[float]
==== `api_key`

Instead of using a username and password, you can use API keys to secure communication
with {es}. The value must be the ID of the API key and the API key joined by a colon: `id:api_key`.

See <<apm-beats-api-keys>> for more information.

[float]
==== `username`

The basic authentication username for connecting to {es}.

This user needs the privileges required to publish events to {es}.
To create a user like this, see <<apm-privileges-to-publish-events>>.

[float]
==== `password`

The basic authentication password for connecting to {es}.

[float]
==== `parameters`

Dictionary of HTTP parameters to pass within the URL with index operations.

[float]
[[apm-protocol-option]]
==== `protocol`

The name of the protocol {es} is reachable on. The options are:
`http` or `https`. The default is `http`. However, if you specify a URL for
<<apm-hosts-option,`hosts`>>, the value of `protocol` is overridden by whatever scheme you
specify in the URL.

[float]
[[apm-path-option]]
==== `path`

An HTTP path prefix that is prepended to the HTTP API calls. This is useful for
the cases where {es} listens behind an HTTP reverse proxy that exports
the API under a custom prefix.

[float]
==== `headers`

Custom HTTP headers to add to each request created by the {es} output.
Example:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch.headers:
  X-My-Header: Header contents
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to specify multiple header values for the same header
name by separating them with a comma.

[float]
==== `proxy_url`

The URL of the proxy to use when connecting to the {es} servers. The
value may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]", in which case the "http"
scheme is assumed. If a value is not specified through the configuration file
then proxy environment variables are used. See the
https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment[Go documentation]
for more information about the environment variables.

ifndef::no_ilm[]
[float]
[[apm-ilm-es]]
==== `ilm`

Configuration options for {ilm}.

See <<ilm>> for more information.
endif::no_ilm[]

ifndef::no-pipeline[]
[float]
[[apm-pipeline-option-es]]
==== `pipeline`

A format string value that specifies the ingest node pipeline to write events to.

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  pipeline: my_pipeline_id
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information, see <<apm-ingest-pipelines>>.

You can set the ingest node pipeline dynamically by using a format string to
access any event field. For example, this configuration uses a custom field,
`fields.log_type`, to set the pipeline for each event:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  pipeline: "%{[fields.log_type]}_pipeline"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this configuration, all events with `log_type: normal` are sent to a pipeline
named `normal_pipeline`, and all events with `log_type: critical` are sent to a
pipeline named `critical_pipeline`.

TIP: To learn how to add custom fields to events, see the
<<libbeat-configuration-fields,`fields`>> option.

See the <<apm-pipelines-option-es,`pipelines`>> setting for other ways to set the
ingest node pipeline dynamically.

[float]
[[apm-pipelines-option-es]]
==== `pipelines`

An array of pipeline selector rules. Each rule specifies the ingest node
pipeline to use for events that match the rule. During publishing, APM Server
uses the first matching rule in the array. Rules can contain conditionals,
format string-based fields, and name mappings. If the `pipelines` setting is
missing or no rule matches, the <<apm-pipeline-option-es,`pipeline`>> setting is
used.

Rule settings:

*`pipeline`*:: The pipeline format string to use. If this string contains field
references, such as `%{[fields.name]}`, the fields must exist, or the rule
fails.

*`mappings`*:: A dictionary that takes the value returned by `pipeline` and maps
it to a new name.

*`default`*:: The default string value to use if `mappings` does not find a
match.

*`when`*:: A condition that must succeed in order to execute the current rule.
ifndef::no-processors[]
All the <<conditions,conditions>> supported by processors are also supported
here.
endif::no-processors[]

The following example sends events to a specific pipeline based on whether the
`message` field contains the specified string:

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: "warning_pipeline"
      when.contains:
        message: "WARN"
    - pipeline: "error_pipeline"
      when.contains:
        message: "ERR"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following example sets the pipeline by taking the name returned by the
`pipeline` format string and mapping it to a new name that's used for the
pipeline:

["source","yaml"]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: "%{[fields.log_type]}"
      mappings:
        critical: "sev1_pipeline"
        normal: "sev2_pipeline"
      default: "sev3_pipeline"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


With this configuration, all events with `log_type: critical` are sent to
`sev1_pipeline`, all events with `log_type: normal` are sent to a
`sev2_pipeline`, and all other events are sent to `sev3_pipeline`.

For more information about ingest node pipelines, see
<<apm-ingest-pipelines>>.

endif::[]

[float]
==== `max_retries`

ifdef::ignores_max_retries[]
APM Server ignores the `max_retries` setting and retries indefinitely.
endif::[]

ifndef::ignores_max_retries[]
The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.

Set `max_retries` to a value less than 0 to retry until all events are published.

The default is 3.
endif::[]

[float]
==== `flush_bytes`

The bulk request size threshold, in bytes, before flushing to {es}.
The value must have a suffix, e.g. `"2MB"`. The default is `1MB`.

[float]
==== `flush_interval`

The maximum duration to accumulate events for a bulk request before being flushed to {es}.
The value must have a duration suffix, e.g. `"5s"`. The default is `1s`.

[float]
==== `backoff.init`

The number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to {es} after
a network error. After waiting `backoff.init` seconds, APM Server tries to
reconnect. If the attempt fails, the backoff timer is increased exponentially up
to `backoff.max`. After a successful connection, the backoff timer is reset. The
default is `1s`.

[float]
==== `backoff.max`

The maximum number of seconds to wait before attempting to connect to
{es} after a network error. The default is `60s`.

[float]
==== `timeout`

The HTTP request timeout in seconds for the {es} request. The default is 90.

[float]
==== `ssl`

Configuration options for SSL parameters like the certificate authority to use
for HTTPS-based connections. If the `ssl` section is missing, the host CAs are used for HTTPS connections to
{es}.

See the <<apm-securing-communication-elasticsearch,secure communication with {es}>> guide
or <<apm-configuration-ssl,SSL configuration reference>> for more information.
