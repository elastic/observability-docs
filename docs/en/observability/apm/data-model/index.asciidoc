Elastic APM agents capture different types of information from within their instrumented applications.
These are known as events, and can be spans, transactions, traces, errors, or metrics.

////
Explain how the different data types relate to each other at a high level
////

Elastic APM helps you see what happens from start to finish when a request is made to an application:

* <<apm-data-model-spans,*Spans*>>: A span contain information about the execution of a specific code path.
  They are the building blocks of _transactions_ and _traces_.
* <<apm-data-model-transactions,*Transactions*>>: A transaction describes an event captured by an Elastic
  APM agent instrumenting a service. A transaction is technically a type of span that has additional
  attributes associated with it and often contains multiple child _spans_. You can think of transactions
  as the highest level of work youâ€™re measuring within a service.
* <<apm-distributed-tracing,*Traces*>>: A trace is a group of _transactions_ and _spans_ with a common root.
  Each trace tracks the entirety of a single request. When a trace travels through multiple services,
  it is known as a _distributed trace_.

In addition to the building blocks of traces, Elastic APM agents also capture:

* <<apm-data-model-errors,*Errors*>>: An error is created when something goes wrong with a request to an application.
  This event contains information to help you determine where and why an error occurred, often including in which
  _transaction_ the error occurred.
* <<apm-data-model-metrics,*Metrics*>>: Metrics measure the state of a system by gathering information on a regular interval.

Events can contain additional <<apm-data-model-metadata,metadata>> which further enriches your data.
