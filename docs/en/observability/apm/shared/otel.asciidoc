Elastic integrates with OpenTelemetry using the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (EDOT), allowing you to reuse your existing instrumentation to easily send observability data to the {stack}.

For more information on how to combine Elastic and OpenTelemetry, see the https://elastic.github.io/opentelemetry/[EDOT documentation].
