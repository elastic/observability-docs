= Fleet-managed APM Server

This guide will explain how to set up and configure a Fleet-managed APM Server.

[float]
== Prerequisites

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing it.
When setting these components up, you need:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/prereq.asciidoc[tag=self-managed]

== Step 1: Set up Fleet

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get APM data into the {stack}.
The first time you use {fleet}, you'll need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/add-fleet-server/content.asciidoc[tag=self-managed]

For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[{fleet-server}].

== Step 2: Add and configure the APM integration

include::{observability-docs-root}/docs/en/observability/tab-widgets/add-apm-integration/content.asciidoc[tag=self-managed]

****
An internet connection is required to install the APM integration via the Fleet UI in Kibana.

== Step 3: Install APM agents

APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each {apm-agent}'s configuration–
to the index that its data is stored in {es}.
Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for {apm-agent} and APM Server communication.
This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.

TIP: You can edit your APM integration settings if you need to change the APM Server URL
or secret token to match your APM agents.

== Step 4: View your data

Back in {kib}, under {observability}, select APM.
You should see application performance monitoring data flowing into the {stack}!
