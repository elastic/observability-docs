NOTE: Starting in version 8.15.0, the {es} apm-data plugin manages APM index templates,
lifecycle policies, and ingest pipelines.

The APM Server receives performance data from your APM agents,
validates and processes it, and then transforms the data into {es} documents.
If you're on this page, then you've chosen to self-manage the Elastic Stack,
and you now must decide how to run and configure the APM Server.
There are two options, and the components required are different for each:

* **<<apm-setup-fleet-managed-apm,Fleet-managed APM Server>>**
* **<<apm-setup-apm-server-binary,APM Server binary>>**
// * **<<setup-apm-server-ea,Standalone Elastic Agent-managed APM Server>>**

== Fleet-managed APM Server

Fleet is a web-based UI in {kib} that is used to centrally manage {agent}s.
In this deployment model, use {agent} to spin up APM Server instances that can be centrally-managed in a custom-curated user interface.

// (outputs, stable APIs)
// not the best option for a simple test setup or if only interested in centrally running APM Server

| *Pros*
a| Conveniently manage one, some, or many different
integrations from one central {fleet} UI.

| *Supported outputs*
a| * {es}
* {ess}

NOTE: Fleet-managed APM Server does support all the outputs that are supported by the APM Server binary method of running Elastic APM.

| *Required{nbsp}components*
a| * APM agents
* {agent} (which runs multiple subprocesses including APM Server, Fleet Server, and {stack})

| *Configuration method*
| {kib} UI
