NOTE: Starting in version 8.15.0, the {es} apm-data plugin manages APM index templates,
lifecycle policies, and ingest pipelines.

The APM Server receives performance data from your APM agents,
validates and processes it, and then transforms the data into {es} documents.
If you're on this page, then you've chosen to self-manage the Elastic Stack,
and you now must decide how to run and configure the APM Server.
There are two options, and the components required are different for each:

* **<<apm-setup-fleet-managed-apm,Fleet-managed APM Server>>**
* **<<apm-setup-apm-server-binary,APM Server binary>>**

[[apm-setup-fleet-managed-apm]]
== Fleet-managed APM Server

Fleet is a web-based UI in {kib} that is used to centrally manage {agent}s.
In this deployment model, use {agent} to spin up APM Server instances that can be centrally-managed in a custom-curated user interface.

*Pros*:

* Conveniently manage one, some, or many different
integrations from one central {fleet} UI.
* Centrally manage multiple APM Servers running on edge machines.

*Supported outputs*:

* {es}
* {ess}

NOTE: Fleet-managed APM Server does _not_ support all the outputs that are supported by the APM Server binary method of running Elastic APM.

*Required components*:

* APM agents
* {agent} (which runs multiple subprocesses including APM Server, Fleet Server, and {stack})

*Configuration method*: {kib} UI

[[apm-setup-apm-server-binary]]
== APM Server binary

Install, configure, and run the APM Server binary wherever you need it.

image::./images/bin-ov.png[APM Server binary overview]

*Pros*:

* Simplest self-managed option
* No addition component knowledge required
* YAML configuration simplifies automation

*Supported outputs*:

* {es}
* {ess}
* {ls}
* Kafka
* Redis
* File
* Console

*Required components*:

* APM agents
* APM Server
* {stack}

*Configuration method*: YAML
