If you'd like to adjust the default settings, see {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[APM Settings].

[[apm-indices-settings]]
== APM Indices status_badge::[cloud_serverless, unavailable]

The Applications UI uses data views to query APM indices.
To change the default APM indices that the Applications UI queries, open the Applications UI and select **Settings** → **Indices**.
Index settings in the Applications UI take precedence over those set in `kibana.yml`.

APM indices are spaces-aware.
Changes to APM index settings will only apply to the currently enabled space.
See <<apm-spaces>> for more information.
