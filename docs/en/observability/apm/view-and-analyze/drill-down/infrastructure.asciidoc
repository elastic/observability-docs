= Infrastructure

beta::[]

The *Infrastructure* tab provides information about the containers, pods, and hosts
that the selected service is linked to:

// Does it make sense to add this here?
* *Pods*: Uses the `kubernetes.pod.name` from the <<apm-data-model-metrics,APM metrics data streams>>.
* *Containers*: Uses the `container.id` from the <<apm-data-model-metrics,APM metrics data streams>>.
* *Hosts*: If the application is containerized--if the APM metrics documents include `container.id`--
the `host.name` is used from the infrastructure data streams (filtered by `container.id`).
If not, `host.hostname` is used from the APM metrics data streams.

IT ops and software reliability engineers (SREs) can use this tab
to quickly find a service's underlying infrastructure resources when debugging a problem.
Knowing what infrastructure is related to a service allows you to remediate issues by restarting, killing hanging instances, changing configuration, rolling back deployments, scaling up, scaling out, and so on.

.Why is the infrastructure tab empty?
====
If there is no data in the Application UI's infrastructure tab for a selected service,
you can read more about why this happens and how to fix it in the
<<troubleshooting-apm-infra-data,troubleshooting docs>>.
