Inventory provides a single place to observe the status of your entire ecosystem of hosts, containers, and services at a glance, even just from logs. From there, you can monitor and understand the health of your entities, check what needs attention, and start your investigations.

NOTE: The new Inventory requires the Elastic Entity Model (EEM). To learn more, refer to <<elastic-entity-model>>.

Inventory is currently available for hosts, containers, and services, but it will scale to support all of your entities.

The EEM currently supports the inventory experience (as identified by `host.name`, `service.name`, and `container.id`) located in data identified by the following index patterns:

**Hosts**

Where `host.name` is set in `metrics-*`, `logs-*`, `filebeat-*`, and `metricbeat-*`

**Services**

Where `service.name` is set in `filebeat*`, `logs-*`, `metrics-apm.service_transaction.1m*`, and `metrics-apm.service_summary.1m*`

**Containers**

Where `container.id` is set in `metrics-*`, `logs-*`, `filebeat-*`, and `metricbeat-*`

Inventory allows you to:

- Filter for your entities to provide a high-level view of what you have leveraging your own tags and labels
- Drill down into any host, container, or service to help you understand performance
- Debug resource bottlenecks with your service caused by their containers and the hosts they run on.
- Easily discover all entities related to the host, container or service you are viewing by leveraging your tags and labels

== Explore your entities

. In your Observability project, go to **Inventory** to view all of your entities.
+
When you open the Inventory for the first time, you'll be asked to enable the EEM. Once enabled, the Inventory will be accessible to anyone with the appropriate privileges.
+
NOTE: The Inventory feature can be completely disabled using the `observability:entityCentricExperience` flag in **Stack Management**.

. In the search bar, search for your entities by name or type, for example `entity.type:service`.

For each entity, you can click the entity name and get a detailed view. For example, for an entity of type service, you get the following details:

- Overview
- Transactions
- Dependencies
- Errors
- Metrics
- Infrastructure
- Service Map
- Logs
- Alerts
- Dashboards

If you open an entity of type `host` or `container` that does not have infrastructure data, some of the visualizations will be blank and some features on the page will not be fully populated.

== Add data

To add entities, select **Add data** from the left-hand navigation and choose one of the following onboarding journeys:

- **Auto-detect logs and metrics**
Detects hosts (with metrics and logs)

- **Kubernetes**
Detects hosts, containers, and services

- **Elastic APM / OpenTelemetry / Synthetic Monitor**
Detects services
Associate existing service logs

To learn how, refer to <<add-logs-service-name>>.
