Because Elastic APM is built on top of the {stack}, you have the full power of Elastic's powerful
search capabilities to filter and search through your application data. Mastering how to filter and
search your data can help you find bottlenecks in your code faster:

* Use global filters to <<apm-filters,filter data>> across the APM UI based on a specific time range or environment.
* Use <<apm-advanced-queries,advanced queries>> on your data to filter on specific pieces of information.
* Use {es}'s <<apm-cross-cluster-search,cross-cluster search>> functionality to search APM data across multiple sources.
