The *Services* inventory provides a quick, high-level overview of the health and general
performance of all instrumented services.

To help surface potential issues, services are sorted by their health status:
**critical** → **warning** → **healthy** → **unknown**.
Health status is powered by <<apm-machine-learning-integration,machine learning>>
and requires anomaly detection to be enabled.

In addition to health status, active alerts for each service are prominently displayed in the service inventory table. Selecting an active alert badge brings you to the <<apm-alerts,Alerts>> tab where you can learn more about the active alert and take action.

Group services together to build meaningful views that remove noise, simplify investigations across services,
and <<apm-alert-view-group,combine related alerts>>.
Service groups are space-specific and available for any users with appropriate access.

To create a service group:

. To open **Service inventory**, find **Applications** in the main menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field].
. Switch to **Service groups**.
. Click **Create group**.
. Specify a name, color, and description.
. Click **Select services**.
. Specify a {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)] query to filter services by one or more of the following dimensions:
`agent.name`, `service.name`, `service.language.name`, `service.environment`, `labels.<xyz>`.
Services that match the query within the last 24 hours will be assigned to the group.

=== Examples

Not sure where to get started? Here are some sample queries you can build from:

* Group services by environment--in this example, "production": `service.environment : "production"`
* Group services by name--this example groups those that end in "beat": `service.name : *beat` (matches services named "Auditbeat", "Heartbeat", "Filebeat", etc.)
