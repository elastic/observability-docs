[[observability-add-data]]
= Send data to {es}

Now that you have provisioned your first deployment of your Elasticsearch cluster, 
youâ€™re ready to ingest your logs, metrics, uptime, and APM data.

To make full use of Elastic Observability, we recommend that you install the observability 
products in the following order:

1. Install and configure {filebeat} on your servers to collect log events.

2. Install and configure {metricbeat} on your servers to collect metrics from 
the operating system and from services running on the server.

3. Install and configure {heartbeat} on your servers to periodically check the status of your 
services.

4. If you have added an APM Server as part of a https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}]
deployment, configure your APM agents  to send data to your {es} cluster.
