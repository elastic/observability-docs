[[inspect-metric-anomalies]]
= Inspect metric anomalies

When the {anomaly-detect} features of {ml} are enabled, you can create {ml} jobs 
to detect and inspect memory usage and network traffic anomalies for hosts and 
Kubernetes pods.

You can model system memory usage, along with inbound and outbound network 
traffic across hosts or pods. You can detect unusual increases in memory usage, 
and unusually high inbound or outbound traffic across hosts or pods.


[[ml-jobs-hosts]]
== Enable {ml} jobs for hosts or Kubernetes pods

Create a {ml} job to detect anomalous memory usage and network traffic 
automatically.

Once the {ml} jobs are created, these settings can not be changed. You can 
recreate these jobs later. However, any previously detected anomalies are 
removed.

1. In the side navigation, click *Observability > Metrics > Anomaly detection*.
2. You’ll be prompted to create a machine learning job for *Hosts* or 
*Kubernetes Pods*.
3. Choose a start date for the machine learning analysis.
+
Machine learning jobs analyze the last four weeks of data and continue to run 
indefinitely.
+
4. Select a partition field.
+
[NOTE]
=====
By default, the Kubernetes partition field `kubernetes.namespace` is selected.
=====
+
Partitions allow you to create independent models for different groups of data 
that share similar behavior. For example, you may want to build separate models 
for machine type, or cloud availability zone, so that anomalies are not weighted 
equally across groups.
+
5. Click *Enable Jobs*.
6. You're now ready to explore your metric anomalies. Click *View anomalies* to 
view the {ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[Anomaly Explorer in Machine Learning].

[NOTE]
=====
These pre-defined {anomaly-jobs} use {ml-docs}/ml-rules.html[custom rules]. You 
can update the rules in the *Anomaly explorer* by selecting the *Configure 
rules* option under *actions*. The changes take effect for new results only. If 
you want to apply the changes to existing results, clone and rerun the job.

[[history-chart]]
== History chart

On the *Inventory* page, click *Show history* to view the metric values within 
the selected time frame. Detected anomalies with an anomaly score equal to 50, 
or higher, are highlighted in red. To examine the detected anomalies, use the 
{ml-docs}/ml-gs-results.html[Anomaly Explorer].
