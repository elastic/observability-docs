[[infrastructure-anomaly-alert]]
= Create an infrastructure anomaly alert

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Make sure to enable anomaly detection for hosts and Kubernetes. For more information,
see <<inspect-metric-anomalies,Inspect metric anomalies>>. 
=====

Within the {metrics-app}, create an infrastructure anomaly alert to receive
notifications based on the memory usage and network traffic anomalies for hosts
and Kubernetes pods.

You can receive notifications when an anomaly severity score exceeds a defined threshold
for increases in memory usage and unusually high inbound or outbound traffic across hosts or pods.

. To access this page, go to *Observability > Metrics*.
. On the *Inventory* page or the *Metrics Explorer* page, click *Alerts > Infrastructure*.
. Select *Create anomaly alert*.

[[anomaly-conditions]]
== Anomaly conditions

Conditions for each alert can be applied to specific metrics relating to the hosts or
Kubernetes pods you select: memory usage, network in, and network out.

For each alert, you can configure which severity score triggers the alert. The default
level is `major`.

|=== 

| *warning* | Score `3` and above.

| *minor* | Score `25` and above.

| *major* | Score `50` and above.

| *critical* | Score `75` and above.

|=== 

In this example, Kubernetes Pods is selected. The conditions state that
an alert is triggered if memory usage has a severity score of `major` for any pods within the `ingress-nginx`
namespace.

Before creating an alert, you can preview whether the conditions would have triggered the alert in
the last hour, day, week, or month.

[[action-types-infra-anomaly]]
== Action types

You can extend your alerts by connecting them to actions that use the following supported
built-in integrations.

[[action-variables-infra-anomaly]]
== Action variables

This section details the variables that infrastructure threshold alerts will send to your
actions.

=== Default variables

image::images/anomaly-variables.png[The default infrastructure anomaly alert message detailing basic variables]

The notification message for an infrastructure anomaly alert contains the following default variables.

- `context.alertState`: Depending on why the action is triggered, this variable resolves to `ALERT`
(the alert condition is detected), `NO DATA` (no data was returned for the time period that was queried),
or `ERROR` (indicates an error when querying the data).
- `context.metric`: The metric name defined in the condition.
- `context.summary`: A description of the anomaly.
- `context.timestamp`: The timestamp of when the anomaly was detected.
- `context.typical`: The typical value of the metric at the time of the anomaly.
- `context.actual`: The actual value of the metric at the time of the anomaly.

[float]
=== Additional variables

You can customize the default notification message by including the following additional variables.

- `context.anomalyScore`: The severity score of the detected anomaly.
- `context.influencers`: A list of nodes that influenced the anomaly.
