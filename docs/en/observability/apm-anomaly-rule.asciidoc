= APM Anomaly rule

APM Anomaly rules trigger when the latency, throughput, or failed transaction rate of a service is abnormal.

[[apm-anomaly-rule-filters-conditions]]
== Filters and conditions

Because some parts of an application may be more important than others, you might have a different tolerance
for abnormal performance across services in your application. You can filter the services in your application to
apply an APM Anomaly rule to specific services (`SERVICE`), transaction types (`TYPE`), and environments (`ENVIRONMENT`).

Then, you can specify which conditions should result in an alert. This includes specifying:

* The types of anomalies that are detected (`DETECTOR TYPES`): `latency`, `throughput`, and/or `failed transaction rate`.
* The severity level (`HAS ANOMALY WITH SEVERITY`): `critical`, `major`, `minor`, `warning`.

.Example
****
This example creates a rule for all production services that would result in an alert when a critical latency
anomaly is detected:

== Actions

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use built-in integrations.

=== Action variables

A default message is provided as a starting point for your alert.
If you want to customize the message, add more context to the message by clicking the icon above
the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.

TIP: To add variables to alert messages, use https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template syntax, for example `{{variable.name}}`.

The following variables are specific to this rule type.
You an also specify {kibana-ref}/rule-action-variables.html[variables common to all rules].

`context.alertDetailsUrl`::
Link to the alert troubleshooting view for further context and details. This will be an empty string if the server.publicBaseUrl is not configured.

`context.environment`::
The transaction type the alert is created for.

`context.reason`::
A concise description of the reason for the alert.

`context.serviceName`::
The service the alert is created for.

`context.threshold`::
Any trigger value above this value will cause the alert to fire.

`context.transactionType`::
The transaction type the alert is created for.

`context.triggerValue`::
The value that breached the threshold and triggered the alert.

`context.viewInAppUrl`::
Link to the alert source.
