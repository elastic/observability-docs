The Observability AI Assistant is a large language model (LLM) integration that helps Elastic Observability users by adding context, explaining errors and messages, and suggesting remediation in the {observability} interface. You can connect the Observability AI Assistant to either the OpenAI or Microsoft Azure LLM service. 

You can find Observability AI Assistant prompts throughout {observability}:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Observability AI Assistant is in technical preview, and its capabilities are still developing. Users should leverage it sensibly as the reliability of its responses might vary. Your insights, patience, and feedback help us calibrate this feature for optimal use. Always cross-verify any returned advice for accurate threat detection and response, insights, and query generation.

Also, the data you provide to the Observability AI assistant is _not_ anonymized, and is stored and processed by the third-party AI provider. This includes any data used in conversations for analysis or context, such as alert or event data, detection rule configurations, and queries. Therefore, be careful about sharing any confidential or sensitive details while using this feature.

[[obs-ai-requirements]]
= Requirements

You need following to use the Observability AI Assistant:

* {stack} version 8.9 and later.

[[obs-ai-set-up]]
= Set up the Observability AI Assistant

Complete the following steps to use the Observability AI Assistant:

. Create an API key with your AI provider to authenticate requests from the Observability AI Assistant. You'll use this in the next step. Refer to your provider's documentation for generating API keys:
+
* https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference[OpenAI]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference[Azure OpenAI Service]

. Update {kib}'s configuration settings to include the Observability AI Assistant feature flag and additional information about your AI set up.
+
.. Navigate to the {kib} configuration settings according to your deployment:
+
** *Self-managed (on-premises) deployments*: Add the configuration to the `kibana.yml` file, which is used to {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configure {kib}].
** *{ecloud} deployments*: Use the YAML editor in the {ecloud} console to add the configuration to {cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html[{kib} user settings].
+
.. Add one of the following configurations that corresponds to the AI service you're using:
+
** *OpenAI*:
+
In the following example, `xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.openAI.apiKey` is the API key you generated in the first step.
+
[source,yaml]
----
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.enabled: true
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.openAI.apiKey: <insert API key>
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.openAI.model: <insert model name, e.g. gpt-4>
----
+
** *Azure OpenAI Service*:
+
In the following example, `xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.azureOpenAI.apiKey` is the API key you generated in the first step, and `xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.azureOpenAI.resourceName` is the name of the Azure OpenAI resource used to deploy your model. 
+
[source,yaml]
----
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.enabled: true
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.azureOpenAI.deploymentId: <insert deployment ID>
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.azureOpenAI.resourceName: <insert resource name>
xpack.observability.aiAssistant.provider.azureOpenAI.apiKey: <insert API key>
----

. If you're using a self-managed deployment, restart {kib}.
