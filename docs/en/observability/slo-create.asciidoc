IMPORTANT: Before creating an SLO, you need to <<slo-privileges, configure your SLO access>>.

To create an SLO, go to *Observability → SLOs*: 

* If you're creating your first SLO, you'll see an introductory page. Click the *Create SLO* button.
* If you've created SLOs before, click the *Create new SLO* button in the upper-right corner of the page.

From here, complete the following:

* <<define-sli,Define your service-level indicator (SLI)>>
* <<set-slo>>
* <<slo-describe>>

[[define-sli]]
== Define your SLI

The type of SLI to use depends on the location of your data. For example, if you're creating an SLO based on raw logs coming from your services, you can use a custom KQL SLI. If you're creating an SLO based on services using application performance monitoring (APM), you can use an APM latency or APM availability SLI. 

See the following table for more on each type of SLI:

[cols="1,1"]
|===

|*Custom KQL* 
|Create an indicator based on any of your {es} indices or index patterns. You define two queries. One query that yields the good events from your index and one that yields the total events from your index. 

*Example:* You can define a custom KQL indicator based on the `service-logs` with the good query defined as `nested.field.response.latency <= 100 and nested.field.env : “production”` and the total query defined as `nested.field.env : “production”`. 
|*Custom Metric*
|Create an indicator to define custom equations from metric fields in your indices.

*Example:* You can define your good query as the `sum of different` and the total query as `total_processed`.
|*Histogram Metric*
|Create an indicator based on either a range aggregation or a value count aggregation for both the good and total events. Filtering with KQL queries is supported on both event types. When using a range aggregation, both the from and to thresholds are required for the range and events are the total number of events within that range.

*Example:*
|*APM latency* 
|Create an indicator based on the APM data that received from your instrumented services and a latency threshold. 

*Example:* You can define an indicator on an APM service named `banking-service` for the `production` environment, and the transaction name `POST /deposit` with a latency threshold value of 300ms.
|*APM availability* 
|Create an indicator based on the APM data received from your instrumented services. 

*Example:* You can define an indicator on an APM service named `search-service` for the `production` environment, and the transaction name `POST /search`.

[[custom-kql-sli]]
=== Custom KQL
When defining a custom KQL SLI, you can set the following fields:

* *Index* — The index or index pattern you want to base the SLI upon.
* *Timestamp field* — The timestamp field used by the index.
* *Query filter* — A filter to apply on the index.
* *Good query* — The KQL query yielding the good events to take into account for computing the SLI.
* *Total query* — The KQL query yielding all events to take into account for computing the SLI.
* *Partition by* — 

[discrete]
[[apm-latency-sli]]

=== APM latency or availability
When defining an APM latency or APM availability SLI, you can set the following fields:

* *Service name* — The APM service name.
* *Service environment* — Either `all` or the specific environment.
* *Transaction type* — Either `all` or the specific transaction type.
* *Transaction name* — Either `all` or the specific transaction name.
* *Threshold (APM latency only)* — The latency threshold in milliseconds (ms) to consider the request as good.
* *Query filter* — An optional query filter on the APM data.

[[set-slo]]
== Set your objectives
After defining your SLI, you need to set your objectives. To set your objectives, complete the following:

* <<slo-budgeting-method, Select your budgeting method>>
* <<slo-time-window, Set your time window>>
* <<slo-target, Set your target/SLO percentage>>

[discrete]
[[slo-budgeting-method]]
=== Select your budgeting method
You can select either an *occurrences* or a *timeslices* budgeting method: 

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Occurrences*
| Uses the number of good events and the number of total events to compute the SLO.

*Example:* You have a 30 day rolling SLO with a 95% target, and over the past 30 days there were 1,355,700 total events. The error budget is `100-95 = 5%`, or about 66,785 bad events tolerated before violating the SLO.

If we had 1,300,000 good events over the same period, the observed value is `Good Events / Total Events = 0.95891421 => 95.89%`.
|*Timeslices*
| Breaks the overall time window into smaller slices of a defined duration and uses the number of good slices over the number of total slices to compute the SLO.

*Timeslice target (%)* - Individual timeslices target that determines if the slice is good or bad.
*Timeslice window (in minutes)* - The size of the timeslice window size.

*Example:* A 30 days rolling SLO defined with 5 min slices has a total of `30*24*12 = 8640` slices.
If the SLO target is 98%, we have a `100-98 = 2%` error budget or `8640 * 0.02 = 172` bad slices available before we violate the SLO.

[[slo-time-window]]
=== Set your time window
Select the durations over which you want to compute your SLO. Then time window uses the data from the defined rolling period. For example, the last 30 days. 

[discrete]
[[slo-target]]
=== Set your target/SLO (%)
The SLO target objective in percentage.

[discrete]
[[slo-describe]]
== Describe your SLO
After setting your objectives, give your SLO a name, a short description, and add any relevant tags.

[[slo-alert-checkbox]]
== SLO burn rate alert rule
When the *Create an SLO burn rate alert rule* checkbox is selected, the *Create rule* window opens immediately after you click the *Create SLO* button.
Here you can define your SLO burn rate alert rule. 
For more information, see <<slo-burn-rate-alert, Create an SLO burn rate rule>>.
