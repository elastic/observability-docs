beta::[]

IMPORTANT: To run Universal Profiling on self-hosted Elastic stack, you need an {subscriptions}[appropriate license].

Here you'll find information on running Universal Profiling when hosting the Elastic stack on your own infrastructure.

Universal Profiling consists of a client part (the Universal Profiling Agent) and a server part (the backend). This documentation focuses on the server part.

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-supported-platforms]]
== Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: Running Universal Profiling on self hosted infrastructure requires an Elastic **Enterprise license**.

* Elastic stack: minimum version 8.12.0, on any Linux distribution (x86_64 or ARM64 architectures), with a Kernel 4.x or higher.
* https://www.elastic.co/ece[ECE]: minimum version 3.7.0, using the 8.12.0 stackpack or higher.
* Kubernetes: version 1.22+, using Helm charts.

NOTE: For Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK), the Universal Profiling backend can be installed using helm charts in standalone mode.
Once installed, you can connect the profiling backend to an existing ECK-managed stack.
Currently, we do not have Profiling Operators and the CRDs necessary for running the Profiling backend natively in ECK.

[[profiling-self-managed-architecture-overview]]
== Architecture overview

The backend is made up of two services: the collector and the symbolizer.

* The collector receives profiling data from the Universal Profiling Agents and sends it to {es}.
It listens on an HTTP server and serves a gRPC endpoint.
* The symbolizer processes debug symbols that are not available on the Universal Profiling Agent, and symbolizes native frames from OS packages.
It also listens on an HTTP server and serves an endpoint to upload private debug symbols.
Refer to <<profiling-add-symbols, Adding symbols>> for more information on the importance of adding symbols.

[[profiling-self-managed-installation]]
== Install the backend

To install the Universal Profiling backend, complete the following steps:

. <<profiling-self-managed-updating, Update the Elastic stack to the minimum supported version>>.
. <<profiling-self-managed-enable-kibana, Enable Universal Profiling in Kibana>>.
. <<profiling-self-managed-setup-kibana, Set up Universal Profiling in Kibana>>.
. <<profiling-self-managed-running, Run the backend applications>>.
. <<profiling-self-managed-install-next-steps, Next steps>>.

If you face any issues during installation, refer to <<profiling-self-managed-troubleshooting, Troubleshooting Universal Profiling backend>>.

After the Universal Profiling installation is complete, refer to <<profiling-self-managed-ops, Operating the Universal Profiling backend>> for more on monitoring and scaling the backend.

[[profiling-self-managed-updating]]
=== Step 1: Update the stack

To install the Universal Profiling backend, you need to be running the minimum supported version of the Elastic stack.
Refer to the following instructions to update the stack on your platform:

* <<profiling-self-managed-updating-ece>>
* <<profiling-self-managed-updating-self-managed>>
* <<profiling-self-managed-updating-k8s>>

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-updating-ece]]
=== ECE

Update ECE to version 3.7.0 or higher, following the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise[installations instructions].

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-updating-self-managed]]
=== Self-managed Elastic stack

WARNING: We don't currently support running the backend applications through Elastic Agent.

. Deploy a minimum version 8.12.0 of the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana).
. Ensure the machines hosting the Universal Profiling backend run a Linux kernel version 4.x or higher.

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-updating-k8s]]
=== Kubernetes

We don't currently support running the _backend_ applications through ECK, but, if you're running an Elastic stack through ECK, you can still connect the Universal Profiling backend applications to it.

. Update the ECK deployment you want to enable Universal Profiling to 8.12.0 or higher.
. If you're not using ECK, ensure your deployments of Elasticsearch and Kibana are configured to use the minimum supported version (8.12.0 or higher).

Continue to <<profiling-self-managed-enable-kibana>>.

[[profiling-self-managed-enable-kibana]]
=== Step 2: Enable Universal Profiling in Kibana

Configure {kib} to enable the Universal Profiling plugin with the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.profiling.enabled: true
----

Refer to the steps for your platform to deploy update the configuration.

[discrete]
=== ECE

Install the 8.12.0 stackpack or higher.
Refer to {ece-ref}/ece-manage-elastic-stack.html#ece-manage-elastic-stack[ECE manage elastic stack] for more information.

In ECE, you don't need to perform any additional steps to enable the Universal Profiling plugin in Kibana.

[discrete]
=== Self-managed Elastic stack

. Edit the Kibana YAML configuration file, usually named `kibana.yml` by adding previous configuration line.
. Restart Kibana to reload the configuration.

[discrete]
=== Kubernetes

If you're using ECK, add the previous configuration line to the `kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1` CRD, placing it under the `spec.config` key.
Refer to the {eck-ref}/k8s-kibana-advanced-configuration.html#k8s-kibana-configuration[ECK documentation] for more on configuring {kib}.

If you're not using ECK, edit the `secret` or `configMap` holding the `kibana.yml` configuration file.
Add the previously mentioned config line, and then perform a rolling restart of the Kibana deployment to reload the configuration.

Continue to <<profiling-self-managed-setup-kibana>>.

[[profiling-self-managed-setup-kibana]]
=== Step 3: Set up Universal Profiling in {kib}

Follow the steps in <<profiling-configure-data-ingestion, Configure data ingestion>> to set up Universal Profiling in {kib}.

**If you're running on ECE**, you can stop after setting up Universal Profiling in {kib}. The integrations server automatically deploys the backend applications.

**If you're not running on ECE**, continue to <<profiling-self-managed-running>>.

[[profiling-self-managed-running]]
=== Step 4: Run the backend applications

The next step is to run the backend applications. To do this:

. <<profiling-self-managed-create-api-keys, Create API keys>> to authenticate the backend applications.
. Run the application on <<profiling-self-managed-running-linux, Linux>> or <<profiling-self-managed-running-kubernetes, Kubernetes>>.

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-create-api-keys]]
== Create API keys

Both the collector and symbolizer need to authenticate to Elasticsearch to process profiling data.
For this, you need to create an API key for each application.

Refer to {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html#create-api-key[Create an API key] to create an API key using {kib}.
Select a *User API key* and assign the following permissions  under *Control security privileges*:

[source,json]
----
{
  "profiling": {
    "indices": [
      {
        "names": [
          "profiling-*"
        ],
        "privileges": [
          "read",
          "write"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Store the "Encoded" version of the API keys, as you will need them to run the Universal Profiling backend.
Continue to <<profiling-self-managed-running-linux>> or <<profiling-self-managed-running-kubernetes>> for information on running the backend applications.

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-running-linux]]
== Run on Linux

Before running the backend applications on Linux, we recommend creating <<profiling-self-managed-running-linux-configfile, configuration files>> to manage the applications.
CLI flags are also supported, but they might result in a more complex management of the backend applications.

Install the backend applications using one of the following options:

1. <<profiling-self-managed-install-os-packages, OS packages (DEB/RPM)>>
2. <<profiling-self-managed-running-linux-container, OCI containers>>
3. <<profiling-self-managed-running-linux-binary, Binary>>: orchestrated with your configuration management system of choice (Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt, etc.)

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-running-linux-configfile]]
=== Create configuration files
The configuration files are in YAML format, and are composed of two top-level sections: an "application" section, and an "output" section.

The "application" section contains the configuration for the backend applications, and the "output" section contains the configuration to connect to where the data will be read and sent to.
The "application" section is named after the name of the binary.
The "output" section currently supports only Elasticsearch.

The configuration files are read from the following default locations:

* Collector: `/etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-collector.yml`
* Symbolizer: `/etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-symbolizer.yml`

You can customize the location of the configuration files by using the `-c` flag when running the application.

For the sake of simplicity, we will use the default locations in the examples below.
We also display the default application settings; you can refer to the comments in the YAML to understand how to customize them.

[discrete]
[[profiling-self-managed-running-linux-configfile-collector]]
==== Collector Configuration file

Copy the content of the snippet below in the `/etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-collector.yml` file.

Customize the content of `pf-elastic-collector.auth.secret_token` with a secret token of your choice.
This token will be used by the Universal Profiling Agent to authenticate to the collector; you cannot use an empty string as a token.
Adjust the `ssl` section if you want to protect the collector's endpoint with TLS.

Customize the content of the `output.elasticsearch` section, using the Elasticsearch endpoint and <<profiling-self-managed-create-api-keys, API key>> to set the `hosts` and `api_key` values, respectively.
Adjust the `protocol` value and other TLS related settings as needed.

With the above commands, the backend containers will serve the HTTP endpoints on the host ports 8260 and 8240, respectively.
We provided the `-v` flag to mount the configuration files in the containers, and then we used the `-c` flag to tell the applications to read the configuration files from the mounted path.

Container processes will be running in the background, you can check the logs with `docker logs <container_name>`, e.g.

[source,shell]

docker logs pf-elastic-collector

. Copy the `pf-elastic-collector` and `pf-elastic-symbolizer` binaries to a directory in the machine's `PATH`.
. Run the backend application processes, instructing them to read the configuration files created previously.

+
[source,shell]
----
pf-elastic-collector -c /etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-collector.yml
pf-elastic-symbolizer -c /etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-symbolizer.yml
----

If you want to customize configuration options passed to the binaries, you can use command line flags. All overrides are specified using the `-E` flag.
For example, if you want to override the `host` value for the `pf-elastic-collector` application, you can use the `-E pf-elastic-collector.host` flag as follows:

[source,shell]
----
pf-elastic-collector -c /etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-collector.yml -E pf-elastic-collector.host=0.0.0.0:8844
----

In the previous example, we configured the collector to listen on all network interfaces on port 8844, instead of the 8260 value contained in the YAML configuration file.

You can use the `-E` flag to override any values contained in the configuration files, as lng as you specify the full YAML path on the command line flag.
We recommend sticking with the configuration files for simpler orchestration.

The same configuration overrides and recommendations apply to the `pf-elastic-symbolizer` binary.

[[profiling-self-managed-running-kubernetes]]
== Run on Kubernetes

We provide https://helm.io[Helm] charts to deploy the backend services on Kubernetes.

To install the backend services, you need to add the Elastic Helm repository to your Helm installation and then install the charts.

We recommend creating a `values.yaml` file defining the Kubernetes-specific options of the chart. If you want to stick with the default values provided by the chart, you don't need to create a `values.yaml` file for each chart.
For the applications' configuration, you can reuse the configuration files detailed in <<profiling-self-managed-running-linux-configfile,"Create configuration files">> and pass them to Helm as a values file (using the `--values` of `-f` flags), or copy them in the `values.yaml` file.

In the example below we don't apply any modifications to the Kubernetes configs, so we will use the default values provided by the chart.

. Install and update the Elastic Helm registry:
+
[source,shell]
----
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm repo update elastic
----

. Install the charts (we are using the `universal-profiling` namespace, but you can customize at will):
+
[source,shell]
----
helm install --create-namespace -n universal-profiling collector elastic/profiling-collector -f /etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-collector.yml
helm install --create-namespace -n universal-profiling symbolizer elastic/profiling-symbolizer -f /etc/Elastic/universal-profiling/pf-elastic-symbolizer.yml
----

. Check the pods are running and read their logs, by following the steps listed in the output of the `helm install` commands.

NOTE: In the previous examples, we used the charts' default values to configure Kubernetes resources. These **do not** include the creation of an `Ingress` resource.
If you want to expose the services to an Universal Profiling Agent and symbtool deployment outside the Kubernetes cluster, you need to set up the `ingress` section of each chart.

Continue to <<profiling-self-managed-install-next-steps>>.

=== Step 5: Next steps

With the backend installed, we recommend testing the backend and reading the documentation on operating the backend

[discrete]
=== Test the backend

Follow the steps described in <<profiling-install-profiling-agent, Install the Universal Profiling Agent>> to install the Universal Profiling Agent on a machine, and verify that the backend is working as expected.

The agent logs will show that the agent is sending data to the backend, and navigating to Kibana you should be able to see data in the **Stacktraces** view.
Inspect the backend services logs to verify that the data is being received and ingested.
If needed, re-configure the backend services with `verbose: true` to get more detailed logs.

If you find issues in the logs, refer to <<profiling-self-managed-troubleshooting, Troubleshooting Universal Profiling backend>>.

=== Operating the backend

Next we recommend reading <<profiling-self-managed-ops, Operating the Universal Profiling backend>> to learn how to monitor and scale the backend on each platform.
