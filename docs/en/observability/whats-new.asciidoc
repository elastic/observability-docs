=== AWS Bedrock support

Elastic Observability 8.13 adds connectivity for AWS Bedrock, specifically for the Claude models. The Bedrock/Claude LLM adapter parses data from AWS using a SerDe stream using `@smithy/eventstream-serde-node` and offers the same experience as the other Elastic LLM connectors (OpenAI and Azure OpenAI). Setup is simple with the Amazon Bedrock connector configuration page.

[[entry-point-contextual-awareness]]
=== Entry point contextual awareness

When entering AI Assistant chat, it will now understand what was on the screen you entered it from. For 8.13, we've added screen context for the SLO list page, the SLO detail page, the alert details page, and the APM service inventory.

[[es-ql-editing-visualization]]
=== ES|QL editing and visualization (tech preview)

When the AI Assistant responses use ES|QL, you can now do the following:

* See the “Display results” of the ES|QL query
* Visualize the query on the generated ES|QL:

Once you get the Lens chart, you can edit it.

Users can save the ES|QL chart on a dashboard. From there they can continue editing the chart.

[[slo-enhancements]]
== SLO enhancements

* Ability to group your SLOs by tag, SLI indicator type, or status
* Ability to triage burn rate alerts

[float]
[[group-filter-slo]]
=== Grouping and filtering SLOs

We have added the ability to group your SLOs by tag, SLI indicator type, or status. SREs can easily scan these groups for a summary of their performance, including the number of healthy SLOs, unhealthy SLOs, and the worst performing SLO.

SREs also have the ability to apply filters by tag or SLO status or using any field available via search bar.

[[triage-burn-rate-alerts]]
=== Triage burn rate alerts

SLO burn rate alerts now have a page to assist with triaging burn rate alerts. This page allows users to get detailed information on the burn rate alert and the history of any other times it has been alerted.
