== AWS serverless log ingestion for faster insight

The elastic-serverless-forwarder application enables you to ingest logs from the
AWS environment into Elastic in a complete serverless fashion. You don’t need to
set up and maintain compute resources, which simplifies the getting started
experience and reduces data onboarding friction. The application is publicly
available in Serverless Application repository (SAR), an AWS-managed repository
for serverless applications.

We started with Amazon S3 in the last release and have now added Kinesis data
streams, CloudWatch logs, and direct SQS queue as additional input options. This
application fits seamlessly into your current operating environment, which means
you don’t need to change any environments to start getting the logs ingested
into Elastic.

and https://github.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder/blob/main/docs/README-AWS.md[documentation].

== Custom AWS logs integration for {agent}

We have added a new Custom AWS logs integration that enables you to ingest any
custom logs from the AWS environment for which we don’t have an existing
out-of-the-box {agent} integration. This new integration supports both
Amazon S3 and CloudWatch logs as an input source for these logs. You can choose
to set up your own index templates and ingest pipelines, and configure the
integration to write data to a specific data stream. You can then use the power
of {kib} to analyze the collected data.

== {agent} Azure virtual machine extension

The new Microsoft Azure VM extension for {agent} provides Azure users a
very simple way to install and register {agent} on all their Azure VM’s.
It automatically installs {agent}, registers it with {fleet}, creates a
separate policy that collects system logs and metrics, and assigns this policy
— all with a single checkbox or command line option.

You can use the Elastic deployment pane on the Azure console to configure
Elastic Azure VM extension with a single click. If you prefer to manage with
scripts, you can use Azure CLI or Powershell to interact with the extension and
get {agent} installed and configured on all your Azure VM’s.

Once configured you can manage the lifecycle of your {agents} from within
{fleet}. For more information, see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-azure-marketplace-native.html[Native Azure integration documentation]
and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/monitor-azure.html[Monitor Microsoft Azure tutorial].

== {agent} support for {ls} output (public beta)

You can now add a {ls} instance as an output to an {agent} policy.
This feature is available as a public beta, with the goal of making it generally
available (GA) in 8.4. Inline instructions are provided to Configure {ls}
for {agent} (as shown below) that step through the requirements to
establish a secure connection between agents and the {ls} instance. Please
note that mutual TLS is enforced when agents are set to write to a {ls} output.

== APM support for {kib} spaces

You can now configure APM UI indices in the context of {kib} spaces. This
enables you to segment APM-related data to leverage {kib} spaces for access
controls and UI performance improvements.

== APM Service groups introduced

APM Service groups provide a simple way to curate services into groups. Group
services together to build curated inventory views that remove noise and
simplify investigations across services. Groups are {kib} space-specific and
available for any users with appropriate access.

You can create Service groups with a simple KQL-based workflow to populate group
members. Once created, group members can interact with the service inventory and
service map within the group context.

Service groups are introduced as part of a technical preview — to enable Service
groups, navigate to {kib} {stack-manage-app} > Advanced Settings > Observability,
and enable **Service groups feature**.

== APM visibility for AWS Lambda Functions

Elastic APM now supports distributed tracing for AWS Lambda Functions running in
production environments. This feature is currently supported by the Java, Python
and Node.js Agents. It provides performance monitoring, error monitoring, and
topology views showing dependencies within the distributed microservices
architecture. Additionally, auto-instrumentation of traces, transactions and
spans out-of-the-box are supported.

The {apm-agent} sends traces to the APM Lambda Extension which is responsible for
APM server interactions. The {apm-agent} identifies cold starts of AWS Lambda
functions and collects trigger-specific information for each Lambda invocation,
as well as metadata associated with the AWS Lambda runtime.

As can be seen in the following screenshot, cold starts of lambda invocations
are directly denoted in the trace waterfall view.

== Support for compressed spans in Elastic APM

You can now reduce storage and processing overheads associated with low-value
spans such as those encountered in an N+1 query to a database or cache.
Normally, it would be quite difficult to analyze a trace waterfall in the UI
involving hundreds of short duration spans. This feature enables such spans to
be represented by a single aggregated span. The compressed span also provides
contextual information such as the total number of spans included, total
duration, and average span duration. This feature is currently supported by the
Java, .NET, Python, GO and PHP Agents.

== New dedicated view for Observability alerting rules

As part of our ongoing improvements to Observability alerting features
(currently available as a technical preview), you can now manage rules via a
dedicated Observability rule management view available from the **Alerts** page.
This means you don’t have to leave the Observability context to view
observability-specific alerting rules, making it easier to find and manage
relevant rules. Use search and filter options to quickly identify and select the
rules you want to manage. In addition to the new view, you can now also include
the *alert reason* message and *View in app* URL as variables within alert
notifications.
