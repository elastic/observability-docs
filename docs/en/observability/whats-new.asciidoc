== APM PHP agent (GA)

In {minor-version}, we're excited to announce that the Elastic APM PHP agent is now generally available!
Thanks to all of you that provided us with valuable feedback on the agent's preview and beta versions.
The PHP agent adds automatic instrumentation for Web frameworks like Laravel, data access technologies
like PHP Data Objects (PDO), client-side networking technologies like curl extension and the Guzzle library.

In addition to this out of the box instrumentation, the PHP Agent also provides a comprehensive Public API
that allows you to custom instrument your PHP applications. If you haven’t had the chance to check out the new agent,
test drive the agent and let us know what you would like to see added to it.

== Automatic ECS compliant logs with APM

During the last few releases, we have focused on improving the experience of visualizing your logs along with your
trace data. This release makes that experience even more seamless. APM agents now do the heavy lifting of creating
the ECS compliant logs for you.

This means all you have to do is deploy an APM agent to ship your logs to {es} so you can visualize them in {kib}.
Check out our documentation for a complete list of logging frameworks supported.

== Native support for OpenTelemetry (Experimental)

OpenTelemetry is emerging as the standardized collection layer for observability data and is designed to enable
organizations to instrument their apps in an open and vendor-neutral manner. Our support for OpenTelemetry is not new.
In July 2020, we released the OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic that acts as a translation layer between OpenTelemetry agents and APM Server.

In {minor-version}, we are pleased to announce the experimental native support of the OpenTelemetry protocol. This experimental integration is currently
available for Elastic {observability} on self-managed deployments and available on {ecloud} and {ece} soon.

This allows you to send collected telemetry data directly from your applications to APM Server. 
Not only does this lower the effort to adopt OpenTelemetry into your existing Elastic architecture, but it also simplifies the architecture by removing
the need to install and manage an extra component.

== ARM support for {beats} and {agent} (Beta)

For {minor-version}, we have released a beta version of https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/23479[Linux aarch64 (ARM)] processor support for {beats} and {agent}. The builds
for this architecture are now available on the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/[download page] for {beats} and {agent}. The Docker image is still a work
in progress and will be coming soon. To make it easier to get started, we are now offering builds rather than the source code to run on these systems.

This support makes it easier to run and monitor your {stack} on ARM systems, such as https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/[AWS Graviton], with up to 40% better price performance.
{beats} and {agent} can also monitor internet-of-things (IoT) devices built on the ARM architecture.

[discrete]
== Correlations in APM

Troubleshooting a performance problem with APM got a whole lot easier with the addition of Correlations as a feature in {minor-version}! Discover what
attributes of your transaction data impact your service's performance or causing errors straight out of the box.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/apm-correlations.png[APM correlations]

While the table in the correlations view helps surface attributes that have the most significant impact on your service, the distribution chart allows
you to visualize how these attributes are distributed compared to what is expected. You can then use these attributes to filter and isolate the root
cause of your performance problems. 

Correlations give you the flexibility of exploring your data your way, which means you can set a different threshold value for your slow transactions
or even specify what attributes you want to run the analysis on, right from the UI. For more information, see our Correlations docs.

== Synthetics: Test run waterfall searching and filtering

Test run our new experimental real browser agent to capture the full page load, including detailed information about each asset and how they perform during the page load in a waterfall.
We’ve enhanced the core capability that shipped in 7.11 by adding the ability to quickly filter the objects by MIME type or match a search string.

[discrete]
== Synthetics: Test run waterfall object details

Additionally, to troubleshoot and proactively spot issues, you can now click on each object and view detailed diagnostic information, including headers
and individual object performance.

[discrete]
== Enhanced metric alerts with warning thresholds

Alert thresholds reflect a level beyond which a monitored system is considered unhealthy. Besides the mandatory alert level (red), sometimes there’s a
need to define a warning level (yellow) to classify a system performance as concerning but not critical. Such distinction is typically used to notify
different groups based on alert severity or define custom routing policies for alert notifications. For example, send warning notifications to Slack and alert
notifications to PagerDuty.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/metrics-alert-threshold.png[Metrics alert thresholds]

For {minor-version}, we’ve added the ability to define warning thresholds for Inventory and Metric threshold alerts. The new warning thresholds are optional
and can be set for every condition specified in a threshold alert. You can now define alert actions for each threshold level, which will only trigger them when reached.

image::images/metrics-alert-actions.png[Metrics alert actions]

[discrete]
== Configurable infrastructure anomaly scope and severity thresholds

In {minor-version}, we’ve added the ability to control what parts of your infrastructure anomaly detection jobs should analyze. You can now use the new filter
option to set the scope for hosts and Kubernetes {ml} jobs. This way, you can configure anomaly detection to only look at your production Kubernetes clusters
located in a particular cloud region or hosts that follow a specific tagging policy.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/infra-anomaly-scope.png[Configure anomaly scope]

Anomaly scores are used to provide a realistic view of the anomaly detection results. The anomaly score is a value from 0 to 100, which indicates the significance
of the anomaly compared to previously seen anomalies.

Not all anomalies are equally significant, so we've added the ability to control what anomalies are
highlighted in the UI based on the anomaly severity threshold. For example, if you are only interested in critical anomalies, this setting makes it easier to
visualize anomalies with a high severity score.

You can define the anomaly severity threshold on the Settings page of the {metrics-app} in {kib}.

== Embedded logs stream view in dashboards

For {minor-version}, we're excited to announce that the logs stream view is now an embeddable component. So when building a new dashboard or editing an
existing one, you can follow the steps below to embed the logs stream view.

[discrete]
== Swimlane charts for visualizing {ml} anomalies

In {minor-version}, we have replaced the anomalies visualization from bar charts to swimlane charts, similar to the anomaly explorer views in our {ml} solution.
The swimlane view enables a three-dimensional visualization experience with time and dataset as first and second dimensions, and color providing the anomaly
severity dimension.

[discrete]
== Sync time across observability apps

Previously, when switching between the Observability apps using the left-hand navigation, we did not always persist the time range selection. In {minor-version}, we improved
the workflow to ensure that the application's timeframe is preserved as users navigate. This improvement dramatically increases the speed and efficiency of
investigation workflows across logs, metrics, traces, and other data types.

[discrete]
== {stack} monitoring out-of-the-box alerts

The {stack} monitoring feature provides a way to keep a pulse on the health and performance of your {es} cluster. These alerts are preconfigured
based on the best practices and provide flexibility to tailor them to meet your specific needs, including changing alert conditions and actions using the setup mode.

We now have the following preconfigured alerts that are automatically created:

* CCR read exceptions
* Cluster health
* CPU usage
* Disk usage
* {es} version mismatch
* {kib} version mismatch
* License expiration
* {ls} version mismatch
* Memory usage (JVM)
* Missing monitoring data
* Nodes changed
* Shard size
* Thread pool search rejections
* Thread pool write rejections

This release adds a new alert for *Shard size* that notifies you when a primary shard exceeds 55 GB in size. You can apply index patterns to configure alerts
for specific indices and modify the size value. The alert helps notify you when a shard grows too large because of misconfigured ILM policy or in cases where
ILM policy may be running into errors. Very large shards can negatively affect the cluster's ability to recover from failure. There is no fixed limit on how
large shards can be, but a shard size of 50GB as a limit has been seen to work for a variety of use-cases.

This release also recreates stack monitoring default watches to Kibana alerts. When you visit the stack monitoring application for the first time, the following
default watches are created as Kibana alerts, and the corresponding watches are deleted following a successful conversion after an upgrade:

* Cluster health
* {es} version mismatch
* {kib} version mismatch
* {ls} version mismatch
* Nodes changed
* License expiration

The default action for these out of the box alerts write to Kibana logs. You should configure additional actions to be notified when these alerts trigger
using your favorite notification method.

== {observability} deployment auto-scaling in {ess} and {ece}

Autoscaling was one of the most requested features from the Elastic Observability community, whether looking for easy ways to keep up with dynamic demands
or extending instrumentation to all applications in an optimized fashion without overpaying for max capacity.

Now, you can let {ecloud} automatically monitor storage utilization and {ml} capacity, adjust resources, and maintain performance with
autoscaling so that you can focus on running your business. Autoscaling is now available for {ecloud} and {ece} 2.9.
Autoscaling monitors both the storage utilization for your {es} data nodes and the available capacity for your {ml} jobs.
Autoscaling automatically adjusts resource capacity to maintain node performance.

You can enable autoscaling using the API, CLI, or from the {ecloud} console. Your {es} data nodes’ capacity grows as you store more data.
Your {ml} node’s memory and CPU capacity will grow or shrink, based on your {ml} jobs' resource requirements. You can also set thresholds to
prevent runaway cluster growth.

[discrete]
== Frozen data tier on object stores like S3 (Technical Preview)

Unlock new value by making object stores like S3 fully searchable with the new frozen tier, which is now in technical preview.
Using the new frozen tier, you can decouple compute from storage, adding the capability to search directly on object storage
such as AWS’s S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Storage.

This functionality allows you to search your data at a fraction of the cost with a trade-off in performance while reducing the
number of dedicated resources needed for a search. By only fetching the data required to complete a query from the object store
and caching this data locally as needed, the frozen tier offers the best search experience while enabling you to store an unlimited amount of data.

With searchable snapshots, you can cost-effectively search across all of your application content and historical workplace records
without breaking the bank. Store more analytics data for marketing analysis or test and release versioned application catalogs for
new deployment strategies. In observability use cases, you no longer need to choose which log, metric, or APM data to delete to save money.
Imagine having the ability to search year over year on application performance without needing to rehydrate your data from backup.
