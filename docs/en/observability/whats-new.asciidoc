== {agent}, {fleet}, and Integrations now generally available (GA)

To make it easier to integrate your systems and applications with the {stack}, we are excited to announce
three significant improvements in the 7.14 release.

First, we are launching the generally available (GA) release of our {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-installation-configuration.html[{agent}],
a single, unified agent for Observability and Security. With fewer things to configure and install,
a single agent will simplify data onboarding.

Second, we are launching the GA release of {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}], which lets you centrally manage an entire fleet
of {agent}s at scale. It acts as a control plane that gives you a real-time view of the agent status. In addition, it allows
you to upgrade {agent}s remotely, execute queries on each host, and also contain security threats.

Third, we are launching our new {integrations} app in {kib} along with our first set of GA {integrations}. With a single click, you can
integrate your systems and applications with the {stack}.

{integrations} provide out-of-the box log parsing, dashboards, machine learning jobs, and more. In addition, you can deploy
{integrations} on {agent}s through {fleet}, allowing you to go from data to insights in seconds. Our new GA {integrations} enable you to
monitor your system infrastructure, including servers, laptops, containers, VMs, and more. You also protect your systems from security
threats and analyze security events. There are over 70 {integrations} available, and we are continuously working on adding more.

== Unenrollment timeout in {fleet}

{agent}s that run in container orchestration environments like ECE or Kubernetes should be stateless by design. When a container is
removed, the agent API keys are deleted. This results in an orphan agent tracked in {fleet}.

Within an agent policy, you can now specify an unenroll timeout to automatically unenroll an {agent} when it does not check into {fleet}
for a period of time. This allows the {agent} to resume if the service or network recovers within the time window. After that,
the {agent} will have to enroll again.

== Removing Beats central management

Beats Central Management was an old solution for centrally managing Beats. It was released as a beta and was deprecated several releases ago.
We are now removing it from {kib}. We recommend that you switch to our new GA release of {fleet} instead.

== Advanced metrics collection from Couchbase Sync Gateway

For 7.14, we’re enhancing the Couchbase integration with support for an extended list of metrics. You can now use the
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-couchbase.html[Couchbase module] in {metricbeat} to collect server metrics from
https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html[Sync Gateway].

The module uses the {metricbeat} Couchbase input to get additional metrics related to resources, cache, database, delta sync, doc imports,
CBL replication, security, and GSI views. With these expanded metrics, we have made sure that only the essential metrics are collected to keep
the consumption of resources appropriate.

== Enhanced granularity of the AWS integration

The pay-as-you-go model gets applied to each granular component of any cloud IaaS or PaaS to create more advanced cloud offerings.
Therefore, it's essential not to administer and govern the whole cloud but instead focus only on the services you use.

We understand that pain and have updated the list of AWS integrations on the Observability {integrations} page, improving the ability to search
quickly, configure, and enable integrations for only those AWS services you are interested in. Again, there is no impact on the ability to enable
the umbrella AWS integration.

== Collect RDS Cluster tags as part of the AWS module in {metricbeat}

With the number of assets increasing in our public and private cloud accounts, tags are becoming critical. Usage of tags can make it easy
to observe aggregate performance across many machines and potentially narrow down the dataset for better comprehension. In addition, you
can use tags to add more dimensions to telemetries so they can be sifted, aggregated, and compared in Elastic visualizations for advanced insights.

For 7.14, we are pleased to announce that you can now collect and use RDS Instance tags and Cluster tags as
part of the RDS metricset of the {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-aws.html[AWS module] in {metricbeat}.

== New Amazon Kinesis Data Streams metricset in the {metricbeat} AWS module

Suppose your applications need complex real-time data stream processing. In that case, chances are you’re using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
for the rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation due to its low response times.

In 7.14, we’ve added the metric collection from Amazon Kinesis Data Stream to our {metricbeat} {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-aws.html[AWS module].
The new Amazon Kinesis Data Stream metricset contains all the essential Kinesis monitoring metrics sourced from AWS CloudWatch.

Our AWS module comes with a prebuilt dashboard where you will see your Kinesis data streams and associated key metrics, giving you an overview
of all your data streams.

== New cluster identifier field for the Kubernetes {metricbeat} Integration

Kubernetes is viewed as the de facto standard for orchestrating and managing application containers. So if you use Elastic Observability and run a
containerized deployment of applications, we have great news.

For 7.14, you can now use a cluster identifier to distinguish between multiple Kubernetes clusters when monitoring and visualizing workloads in
Elastic Observability. For a holistic view of your deployments, you can also quickly identify which cluster each node and pod belongs to.
