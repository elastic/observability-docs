== New Synthetics App enhancements for public beta

As we progress towards delivering an all new Synthetic Monitoring capability
within Elastic Observability, we’re excited to announce two big new enhancements
for our 8.4 stack release:

- Private testing locations
- Open access to the managed testing service for all Elastic Cloud users

With private testing locations you can now configure a testing location on
self-managed infrastructure. This means you can test applications that
aren’t publicly available on the internet or from locations where Elastic may not
yet have a managed testing node presence.

A big part of our new Synthetics app is the ability to run synthetic monitoring
tests on our new global network of managed testing locations. With the 8.4
release, we’ll no longer be requiring users to request access. To
use our managed testing infrastructure, open the {uptime-app} and click
*Monitor Management*. There is a fair usage cap in place but all test executions
are free. We’d love to get you involved and https://discuss.elastic.co/c/observability/82[get your feedback].

== Observability alerting and rules views now generally available (GA)

Alerting and rule management for Observability-specific alerts and rules have
been offered as a technical preview since 7.16. We have made significant
improvements since then and we now have robust, feature-rich
capabilities that are production ready.

Working alongside Cases functionality for incident management, Observability
*Alerts* and *Rules* views provide an easy way to access and manage
Observability-specific rules, alerts, and cases within the Observability UI.
With comprehensive filtering and search support, you can quickly view or edit
alerts or rules of interest.

The rule details page offers rule creators and
administrators a complete history of rule executions and seamless access to
generated alerts for effective management. In 8.4 the rule details page has been
further enhanced to include an at-a-glance alert summary that shows the status
and timeline for triggered alerts, along with a number of other UI improvements,
including bulk action support.

== Improved RCA flows for erroneous services

With two new _Top 5_ views introduced for version 8.4, you can quickly identify
the impact of application errors and reduce time spent identifying and tracking
errors.

The *Top 5 errors* view is available from the APM Transaction details page:

The *Top 5 affected transactions* view is available from the APM Error Group
details pages:

== Contextual view of infrastructure metrics for APM Services (Beta)

Bringing together metric and trace data provides powerful insights to help you
understand application performance and identify the source of any issues.
Available as a beta feature in 8.4, Infrastructure metrics for containers, pods,
and hosts are available in the context of individual services. You can use the new
Infrastructure tab in the APM Service Overview to get a summary view of the
infrastructure supporting a service, and drill down into metrics
for additional details.

== Native onboarding flow for Open Telemetry instrumentation

With Elastic APM already natively supporting the OpenTelemetry protocol,
instrumentation instructions have been added to Elastic {apm-agent} onboarding to
simplify and streamline the use of OpenTelemetry agents with Elastic APM.

In addition, APM Server has now added support for ingestion of OpenTelemetry
summary metrics (sum and count), including those created by Prometheus exporters.

For more information, refer to the {apm-guide-ref}/open-telemetry.html[OpenTelemetry documentation]

[discrete]
== Custom ingest pipeline support for APM integration

The Elastic APM integration now supports custom ingest pipelines. A custom
pipeline allows you to transform data to better match your specific use case.
This can be useful, for example, to ensure data security by removing or
obfuscating sensitive information.

For more information, refer to the {apm-guide-ref}/ingest-pipelines.html[Ingest pipelines documentation]

== Customisable Kubernetes dashboards available out-of-the-box

With Elastic Observability 8.4, ITOps and SRE teams can leverage out-of-the-box
Kubernetes dashboards for cluster-level visibility into essential Kubernetes
components (nodes, pods, deployments, etc.). Notable features include:

- Highly customizable dashboards – you can use Kibana Lens to update or remove
panels, or create new panels using the smart suggestion capability
- Improved navigation between related Kubernetes components and dashboards with
Kibana’s drill-down capability

Get at-a-glance correlation of signals gathered from K8s clusters, and gain
better insight into cluster status with highly customizable resource-centric
views that are easy to use and share.

== Monitor your IIS server performance

Take advantage of the new IIS integration which makes it easier than ever to
monitor and visualize IIS and .NET metrics in the context of web services
running on IIS, including alerting for user experience issues.

This new integration provides deep visibility into each web server process group
and helps correlate host and NW metrics with web server-specific metrics for
better fault identification and isolation.

== Monitor VM health and performance from system perspective

The new vSphere integration enables optimal splitting and performance allocation
between VMs. You can now reduce time to detect problems and pinpoint the root
cause in your virtualization and application layer by discovering how your
virtualized configuration impacts your app servers and end user experience.
