== Ingest logs from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/[Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose] is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) streaming data pipeline service that reliably captures, transforms, and delivers streaming data. Users configure data producers to send data to Kinesis Data Firehose and, with {kinesis-firehose-ref}/aws-firehose-setup-guide.html[this new GA integration], Kinesis Data Firehose delivers the data to Elastic Cloud in AWS. Elastic appears as a drop-down option when configuring the Kinesis delivery stream in the AWS console UI, and along with pre-filled default values for most configuration settings, this makes it a direct, easy, agentless setup process to send log data to Elastic.

== APM Server binary

When the Elastic APM Server Integration was introduced in version 7.16, documentation was updated to state that the standalone APM Server binary was termed “legacy” and would deprecated in a future release. After careful consideration of learnings and feedback, the APM Server binary (legacy, standalone) will _not_ be deprecated.

Starting with version 8.8, we are returning full support for standalone APM Server binary for self-managed deployments. The documentation has been updated accordingly, completely removing the “legacy” terminology and deprecation notices.  Moving forward, you can choose between two equally supported options:

* With the Elastic APM integration (Fleet-managed)
* With the standalone APM Server binary

// *Refer to the {apm-guide-ref}/apm-overview.html[APM documentation] for more information.*

== Service-level objectives in beta

beta[]

In 8.8, we are introducing new Service-level objectives (SLOs) management in Elastic Observability, which provides a powerful new way to measure and monitor your service quality over time.

SLOs allow you to set clear, measurable targets for your service performance based on factors like availability, response times, error rates, and other key metrics. You can define SLOs based on different types of data sources like custom KQL queries, APM latency or availability data, and more to come.

image::images/whats-new-slo-create-new.png[]

Once you've defined your SLOs, you can monitor them in real time, with detailed dashboards and alerts that help you quickly identify and troubleshoot issues. You can also track your progress against your SLO targets over time, with a clear view of your error budgets and burn rates.

image::images/whats-new-slo-list.png[]

Support for https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/#6:~:text=6%3A%20Multiwindow%2C%20Multi%2DBurn%2DRate%20Alerts[multiwindow burn rate alerting] on SLOs, as defined by the Google SRE book, is included. This allows you to get alerted when the burn rate of your SLO is above a defined threshold for two different lookback windows:

* A long window, which you define.
* A shorter window, which is automatically defined as 1/12th of the long window.

For example, if you set the long window to 1 hour, the short window will be set to 5 minutes.

Then for each lookback window, we compute the burn rate as the error rate divided by the error budget. When both burn rates are above the threshold, we trigger an alert.

== Enhanced rule definition with context attributes

You can now enhance Observability alert rule definitions with context attributes. For example, alerts can be based on specific variables like transaction types, error groups, host names, or cloud region. This allows for more granular controls on alerting to reduce alert fatigue and make notifications more actionable.

== Alert details view

Alert details pages have been added for APM latency alerts. The Alert details page provides the alert history and related information. You can use the alert detail page to gather information necessary to define the impact, urgency, and next steps for resolving an alert. APM latency gets the first alert detail page for triaging alerts, but many more are coming for other Observability alerts in upcoming releases.

== Easier filtering, previewing hosts and viewing logs and alerts in Infrastructure Hosts 

******
*We want your feedback!* +
Want to provide feedback and preview early builds of the Hosts feature? https://ela.st/hosts-whats-new-opt-in[Let us know!]
******

The <<analyze-hosts,Hosts>> feature now allows you to view and filter by metadata (as well as processes) in the new preview fly-out available on each host to make it easier to compare similar hosts:

image::images/whats-new-infrastructure-hosts-preview.png[Previewing a host to view metadata and processes]

You can also search the logs for your hosts using the new logs tab to find the logs to help you further your investigations:

image::images/whats-new-infrastructure-hosts-search-logs.png[Searching logs for your hosts]

The new alerts tab shows you at a glance if there are any active alerts in your hosts so you can dig into any active issues:

image::images/whats-new-infrastructure-hosts-view-active-alerts.png[Viewing active alerts]

There is also now a host limit to allow you to run quicker queries by limiting the number of hosts being returned in your query so you don't lose focus in your workflow:

image::images/whats-new-infrastructure-hosts-set-limit.png[Setting a host limit]

There have also been various UI improvements such as a sticky universal search bar so you can see and manipulate your queries from anywhere on the page and also viewport-based loading of metrics charts to improve the responsiveness of the page.
