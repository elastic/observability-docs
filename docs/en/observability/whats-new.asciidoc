== General Availability of Service Level Objectives

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) has been updated from Beta to generally available for our Platinum and Enterprise subscription customers. As part of the general release, the SLOs feature has added several updates for our SRE and DevOps users.

To make it easier to monitor large numbers of SLOs users can now have multiple view options on the SLO overview page. New options for Card view and table view are now available.

As we know many of our users like to add their SLO overview visualizations to their custom dashboards. Now it is easier to add the SLO overview in the SLO details page, but you can also add an Alert visualization to view any burn rate alerts that are related to specific SLOs to dashboards as well.  Users can add a new SLO alerts widget, if they want to see a summary and a list of their SLO alerts. They have the option to select multiple SLOs, edit the configuration and interact with the alert widget.

There is a new chart on the SLO details page showing the good vs bad events that have happened over the past 24 hours for faster investigation when an SLO is breached.

For SLO burn rate alerting there is a new way to define your burn rate windows based on the amount of budget consumed, this will allow SREs to define how much budget they are willing to spend before they receive the alert. There is an option to switch between “burn rate mode” and “budget consumed mode” using a toggle below the window definitions. There is also helper text to view what the burn rate would be for the budget defined for the time window. There is also new corresponding helper text to show how much budget would be consumed when defining the window in “burn rate mode”.

SLO’s also have a new Service Level Indicator (SLI) for Time Slice metrics in v8.12. This new SLI can be used for statistical aggregations,  which allows for the use of aggregations like avg, max, min, sum, std_devation, last_value, percentile, and doc_count along with a custom equation and threshold. Because these aggregations are based on the windows size they will be calculated based on a timeslice budgeting method.
