== Get alerts with new Opsgenie integration

With an out-of-the-box Opsgenie integration now available in Elastic
Observability 8.6, alerts generated in Elastic can be seamlessly sent to
Opsgenie for efficient incident response and management. Upon alert recovery in
Elastic, the corresponding alert in Opsgenie will be automatically closed,
eliminating the need for manual alert closure and management.

== New Operations view for APM Dependencies (Beta)

Elastic Observability 8.6 includes a new view that leads site reliability
engineers (SREs) directly to problem areas with application dependencies. This
drives faster root cause analysis by making it possible to easily access:

- All operations (spans) related to a particular instance of a dependency,
including aggregate views for latency, throughput, failed transaction rate, and
impact
- Interactive latency distribution graphs to isolate long running operations
- Trace waterfalls for individual instances of an operation to drill into the
end-to-end experience of the entire related transaction

== New {agent} integrations for Prometheus and Istio

With new {agent} integrations for Prometheus and Istio you can reap the
benefits of using {agent} (new indexing strategy, unified management with
  Fleet) and ingest data from one of the most popular cloud native projects and
  from the most popular service mesh. Add the integration to your deployment and
  start using out-of-the-box dashboards.

This integration can collect metrics from:

- Prometheus Exporters (Collectors)
- Prometheus Server Remote-Write
- Prometheus Queries (PromQL)

== Improvements to rules and alerts

Rich contextual attributes are now available for inclusion in alert notifications
for inventory and metric threshold rules. These are made available
as Mustache variables that you can choose to include in notification templates
when you define the rules. These attributes help you better
understand where these alerts are occuring, and provide quick access to tags and labels
for the source entities on which these alerts are triggered, allowing you to
route the alerts to the right teams within your organization and enable the
correct next steps in third party incident management systems.

The new search bar in the Alerts application enables you to zoom into alerts
generated by a rule, and helps you understand alert volumes and make quick changes.

You can now also clone rules by using the *Duplicate rule* feature and then
editing the definition.

== New integrations for Citrix ADC and Jolokia

Formerly known as NetScaler, ADC is an application delivery and load balancing
solution for monolithic and microservice-based applications. This new {agent}
integration is available in Beta and enables you to:

- Monitor Citrix ADC instances, and visualize and correlate the metrics with other
applications and services in the topology
- Measure and optimize the load, request/response trends and key data, and derive business insights
- Create alerts to reduce the MTTD and MTTR

Out-of-the-box dashboards are provided with the integration - please refer to
https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/citrix_adc[Citrix ADC docs] for more information.

In addition, as a technical preview, we have released an input package for
Jolokia that enables you to collect metrics from Jolokia agents running on a
target JMX server or dedicated proxy server.

For more information, please refer to https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/jolokia[Jolokia integration docs].
