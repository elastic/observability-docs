Whether you’re an analyst or an admin, {kib} makes your data actionable by providing
three key functions. {kib} is:

* **An open-source analytics and visualization platform.**
Use {kib} to explore your {es} data, and then build beautiful visualizations and dashboards.

* **A UI for managing the {stack}.**
Manage your security settings, assign user roles, take snapshots, roll up your data,
and more &mdash; all from the convenience of a {kib} UI.

* **A centralized hub for Elastic's solutions.** From log analytics to
metrics discovery to APM, {kib} is the portal for accessing these and other capabilities.

Within {kib}, the *{observability} Overview* page contains a wide variety of charts
displaying analytics relating to the components that help you make your systems
observable: logs, metrics, APM, and uptime data.

Additionally, the alerts chart keeps you informed of any issues that you may need
to resolve quickly.

[[view-alerts]]
== Alerts

The *Alerts* table provides a snapshot of alerts occurring within the specified time frame.
The table includes the alert status, when it was last updated, the reason for the alert, and more.

To see more details about these alerts, click *Show alerts*. For more information on creating and managing alerts,
see <<create-alerts,Create rules>>.

[[view-log-rates]]
== Log Events

The *Log Events* chart helps you to detect and inspect possible log anomalies across each of
your ingested log sources. The visualization helps you determine if the log rate is outside
of your expected bounds, and therefore could be considered anomalous. Any drop in the log
rate could suggest a system has stopped responding, or a spike could denote a DDoS attack.

To drill down and view these logs in the *{logs-app}*, click *Show log stream*. For more information,
see <<monitor-logs,Monitor logs>>.

//TODO: what are the specific metric fields?

[[view-system-metrics]]
== Hosts

The *Hosts* table displays your top hosts with the most significant
resource footprints. These metrics help you evaluate host efficiency and determine if
resource consumption is impacting end-users.

Uptime, memory usage, and the system load metrics enable you to identify
possible memory leaks and whether disk resources need to be added or redistributed. Inbound and
outbound traffic metrics allow you to visualize any possible spikes to help determine whether
any hosts are choking your network.

To drill down and view these performance metrics in the *{metrics-app}*, click *Show inventory*.
For more information, see <<analyze-metrics,Analyze metrics>>.

[[view-services-and-transactions]]
== Services

The *Services* chart displays the total number of services running within your environment
and the total number of transactions per minute that were captured by the Elastic APM
agent instrumenting those services.

To drill down and view this APM data in the *{apm-app}*, click *Show service inventory*.

[[view-systems-availability]]
== Monitors

To help you react quickly to availability issues before they affect your users, the *Uptime*
chart provides you with a snapshot of the overall availability of your hosts, network devices, or third-party
services. Based on the last check reported by {heartbeat}, you can view the total number of detected monitors,
along with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

To drill down and view this uptime data in the *{uptime-app}*, click *Show monitors*.
For more information, see <<monitor-uptime-synthetics,Monitor uptime data>>.

[[view-user-experience]]
== {user-experience}

The *{user-experience}* chart provides a snapshot of core web vitals for the service with the most traffic.
User experience provides a way to quantify and analyze the perceived performance of your web application.
Unlike testing environments, {user-experience} data reflects real-world user experiences.
Drill down further by looking at data by URL, operating system, browser, and location —
all of which can impact how your application performs on end-user machines.

To drill down and view this {user-experience} data, click *Show dashboard*.
For more information, see <<user-experience,{user-experience}>>.
