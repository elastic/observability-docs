Whether you’re an analyst or an admin, {kib} makes your data actionable by providing
three key functions. {kib} is:

* **An open-source analytics and visualization platform.**
Use {kib} to explore your {es} data, and then build beautiful visualizations and dashboards.

* **A UI for managing the Elastic Stack.**
Manage your security settings, assign user roles, take snapshots, roll up your data,
and more &mdash; all from the convenience of a {kib} UI.

* **A centralized hub for Elastic's solutions.** From log analytics to
metrics discovery to APM, {kib} is the portal for accessing these and other capabilities.

Within {kib}, the *Observability Overview* page contains a wide variety of charts
displaying analytics relating to the components that help you make your systems
observable: logs, metrics, APM, and uptime data.

Additionally, the alerts chart keeps you informed of any issues that you may need
to resolve quickly.

[[view-services-and-transactions]]
== Services and transactions

The *APM* chart displays the total number of services running within your environment
and the total number of transactions per minute that were captured by the Elastic APM
agent instrumenting those services.

To drill-down and view this APM data in the *APM app*, click *View in app*.

[[view-log-rates]]
== Log rates

The *Logs* chart helps you to detect and inspect possible log anomalies across each of
your ingested log sources. The visualization helps you determine if the log rate is outside
of your expected bounds, and therefore could be considered anomalous. Any drop in the log
rate could suggest a system has stopped responding, or a spike could denote a DDos attack.

To drill-down and view these logs in the *Logs app*, click *View in app*. For more information,
see <<monitor-logs,Monitor logs>>.

[[view-system-metrics]]
== System metrics

The *Metrics* chart provides you with a quick glance of the performance metrics
aggregated on all of your running hosts. The metrics help you to evaluate the efficiency
of hosts and determine whether there is any impact of resource consumption for your end-users.

CPU usage, memory usage, and disk used metrics enable you to identify possible memory leaks,
and whether disk resources need to be added or redistributed. Inbound and outbound traffic
metrics provide you with a visualization of any possible spikes to help determine whether
any hosts are choking your network. 

To drill-down and view these performance metrics in the *Metrics app*, click *View in app*.

[[view-systems-availability]]
== Systems availability 

To help you react quickly to availability issues before they affect your users, the *Uptime*
chart provides you with a snapshot of the overall availability of your hosts, network devices, or third-party
services. Based on the last check reported by {heartbeat}, you can view the total number of detected monitors,
along with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

To drill-down and view this uptime data in the *Uptime app*, click *View in app*.

[[view-alerts]]
== Alerts 

To help keep you aware of potential issues in your environments, the *Alerts* feed 
provides a snapshot of the alerts occurring within the specified time frame. Displayed are the 
alert types, your specified tags, and the number of instances of each alert within that time frame. 

To {kibana-ref}/alert-management.html[create or edit alerts], click *Manage alerts*.
