= Monitor environments

Displayed on the *Observability Overview* page are a wide variety of chart
visualizations that provide you with a quick glance of analytical information on
what is happening across your environments.

The *Overview* page contains charts displaying analytics relating to the components
that help you make your systems observable; logs, metrics, APM, and uptime data.

Additionally, the alerts chart and alerts activity feed keep you informed of any 
issues that you may need to resolve quickly.

=== Services, transactions, and error rates

The *APM summary* chart provides you with an overview of the total number of running services
within your environment, along with the total number of transactions that were captured
by the Elastic APM agent instrumenting those services. Additionally, to help you
quickly identify error rate spikes relating to your applications, the error rate across
the transactions is displayed as a percentage.

=== Log rates

The *Log rate* chart helps you to detect and inspect log anomalies across each of
your ingested log sources. The visualization highlights where the log rate is outside
of expected bounds, and therefore could be considered anomalous. A drop in the log
rate could suggest a system has stopped responding, or a spike could denote a DDos attack.

=== System metrics

The *Metrics summary* chart provides you with a quick glance of the performance metrics
aggregated on all of your running hosts. The metrics help you to evaluate the efficiency
of hosts and determine whether there is any impact of resource consumption for your end-users.

CPU usage, memory usage, and disk used metrics enable you to identify possible memory leaks,
and whether disk resources need to be added or redistributed. Inbound and outbound traffic
metrics provide you with a visualization of any possible spikes to help determine whether
any hosts are choking your network.

=== Systems availability 

To help you react quickly to availability issues before they affect your users, the *Uptime summary*
provides you with a snapshot of the overall availability of your hosts, network devices, or third-party
services. You can view the total number of detected monitors, and the state of each one; whether
they are up or down with a specific timeframe.

=== Alerts 

To help keep you aware of potential issues in your environments, the *Alerts activity* feed 
provides a snapshot of the alerts occurring within a specific time frame. Displayed are the 
alert types, your specified tags, and the number of instances of each alert within that time frame.
