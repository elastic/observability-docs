= Monitor environments

Displayed on the *Observability Overview* page are a wide variety of chart
visualizations that provide you with a quick glance of analytical information on
what is happening across your environments.

The *Overview* page contains charts displaying analytics relating to the components
that help you make your systems observable; logs, metrics, APM, and uptime data.

Additionally, the alerts chart keeps you informed of any issues that you may need
to resolve quickly.

=== Services and transactions

The *APM* chart displays the total number of services running within your environment
and the total number of transactions per minute that were captured by the Elastic APM
agent instrumenting those services.

To drill-down into this APM data, click {kibana-ref}/services.html[*View in app*].

=== Log rates

The *Logs* chart helps you to detect and inspect possible log anomalies across each of
your ingested log sources. The visualization helps you determine if the log rate is outside
of your expected bounds, and therefore could be considered anomalous. Any drop in the log
rate could suggest a system has stopped responding, or a spike could denote a DDos attack.

=== System metrics

The *Metrics* chart provides you with a quick glance of the performance metrics
aggregated on all of your running hosts. The metrics help you to evaluate the efficiency
of hosts and determine whether there is any impact of resource consumption for your end-users.

CPU usage, memory usage, and disk used metrics enable you to identify possible memory leaks,
and whether disk resources need to be added or redistributed. Inbound and outbound traffic
metrics provide you with a visualization of any possible spikes to help determine whether
any hosts are choking your network.

=== Systems availability 

To help you react quickly to availability issues before they affect your users, the *Uptime*
provides you with a snapshot of the overall availability of your hosts, network devices, or third-party
services. You can view the total number of detected monitors, and the state of each one; whether
they are up or down within a specific timeframe.

To drill-down into this uptime data, click {uptime-guide}/uptime-app.html[*View in app*].

=== Alerts 

To help keep you aware of potential issues in your environments, the *Alerts* feed 
provides a snapshot of the alerts occurring within a specific time frame. Displayed are the 
alert types, your specified tags, and the number of instances of each alert within that time frame.
