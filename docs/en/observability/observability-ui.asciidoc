Whether you’re an analyst or an admin, {kib} makes your data actionable by providing
three key functions. {kib} is:

* **An open-source analytics and visualization platform.**
Use {kib} to explore your {es} data, then build beautiful visualizations and dashboards. 

* **A UI for managing the Elastic Stack.**
Manage your security settings, assign user roles, take snapshots, roll up your data,
and more &mdash; all from the convenience of a {kib} UI.

* **A centralized hub for Elastic's solutions.** From log analytics to
metrics discovery to APM, {kib} is the portal for accessing these and other capabilities.

Within {kib}, the *Observability Overview* page contains a wide variety of charts
displaying analytics relating to the components that help you make your systems
observable: logs, metrics, APM, and Uptime data.

Additionally, the alerts chart keeps you informed of any issues that you may need
to resolve quickly.

[[view-services-and-transactions]]
== Services and transactions

The *APM* chart displays the total number of services running within your environment
and the total number of transactions per minute that were captured by the Elastic APM
agent instrumenting those services. 

Drill down and view this APM data in the *APM app* by clicking *View in app*.

[[view-log-rates]]
== Log rates

The *Logs* chart helps you to detect and inspect possible log anomalies across each of
your ingested log sources. The visualization helps you determine if the log rate is outside
of your expected bounds, and therefore could be considered anomalous. Any drop in the log
rate could suggest a system has stopped responding, or a spike could denote a DDos attack.

Drill down and view these logs in the *Logs app* by clicking *View in app*. For more information,
see <<monitor-logs,Monitor logs>>.

[[view-system-metrics]]
== System metrics

The *Metrics* chart provides a quick glance of the performance metrics
aggregated on all of your running hosts. The metrics help you to evaluate the efficiency
of hosts and determine whether there is any impact of resource consumption for your end users.

CPU usage, memory usage, and disk used metrics help to identify possible memory leaks,
and whether disk resources need to be added or redistributed. Inbound and outbound traffic
metrics visualize any possible spikes to help determine whether
any hosts are choking your network.

Drill down and view these performance metrics in the *Metrics app* by clicking *View in app*.
For more information, see <<analyze-metrics,Analyze metrics>>.

[[view-systems-availability]]
== Systems availability

Use the *Uptime* chart to react quickly to availability issues before they affect your users. View a snapshot of the overall availability of your hosts, network devices, or third-party services. Based on the last check reported by {heartbeat}, view the total number of detected monitors,
along with the number of monitors in an `up` or `down` state.

Drill down and view this uptime data in the *Uptime app* by clicking *View in app*.
For more information, see <<monitor-uptime,Monitor uptime data>>.

[[view-user-experience]]
== User experience

*User experience* provides a way to quantify and analyze the perceived performance of your web application.
Unlike testing environments, user experience data reflects real-world users experiences.
Drill down further by looking at data by URL, operating system, browser, and location —
all of which can impact how your application performs for an end user.

Drill down and view this user experience data by clicking *View in app*.
For more information, see <<user-experience,User experience>>.

[float]
[[view-alerts]]
== Alerts

To help keep you aware of potential issues in your environments, the *Alerts* feed
provides a snapshot of the alerts that are occurring within the specified time frame. This shows the
alert types, your specified tags, and the number of instances of each alert within that time frame.

To {kibana-ref}/alert-management.html[create or edit alerts], click *Manage alerts*. For more
information about specific alerts that you can create, see <<create-alerts,Create alerts>>.
