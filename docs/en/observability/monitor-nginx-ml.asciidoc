== Part 5: Find anomalies in your nginx access logs

Use the {integrations-docs}/nginx[nginx Elastic integration] machine learning (ML) module to help find unusual activity in your nginx access logs.
Monitoring anomalies in your access logs helps you detect:

* security threats
* network issues
* system performance issues
* operational efficiency issues

[[monitor-nginx-ml-jobs]]
=== nginx anomaly detection jobs

The nginx ML module provides the following anomaly detection jobs:

[[horizontal]]
Low request rates (`low_request_rate_nginx`):: Uses the {ml-docs}/ml-count-functions.html#ml-count[`low_count`] function to detect abnormally low request rates. Abnormally low request rates might indicate that network issues or other issues are preventing requests from reaching the server.
Unusual source IPs - high request rates (`source_ip_request_rate_nginx`):: Uses the {ml-docs}/ml-count-functions.html#ml-count[`hight_count`] function to detect abnormally high request rates from individual IP addresses. Many requests from a single IP or small group of IPs might indicate something malicious like a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack where a large number of requests are sent to overwhelm the server and make it unavailable to users.
Unusual source IPs - high distinct count of URLs (`source_ip_url_count_nginx`):: Uses the {ml-docs}/ml-count-functions.html#ml-distinct-count[`high_distinct_count`] function to detect individual IP addresses accessing abnormally high numbers of unique URLs. A single IP accessing many unique URLs might indicate something malicious like web scraping or an attempt to find sensitive data or vulnerabilities.
Unusual status code rates (`status_code_rate_nginx`):: Uses the {ml-docs}/ml-count-functions.html#ml-count[`count`] function to detect abnormal error status code rates. A high rate of status codes could indicate problems with broken links, bad URLs, or unauthorized access attempts. A high rate of status codes could also point to server issues like limited resources or bugs in your code.
Unusual visitor rates (`visitor_rate_nginx`):: Uses the {ml-docs}/ml-count-functions.html#ml-nonzero-count[`non_zero_count`] function to detect abnormal visitor rates. High visitor rates could indicate something malicious like a DDoS attack.
Low visitor rates could indicate issues with access to the server.

NOTE: These anomaly detection jobs are available when you have data that matches the query specified in the ML module manifest. Users not following this tutorial can refer to {integrations-docs}/nginx#ml-modules[nginx integration ML modules] for more about the ML module manifest.

[[monitor-nginx-ml-prereqs]]
=== Before you begin

Verify that your environment is set up properly to use the {ml-features}.
If {es} {security-features} are enabled, you need a user with permissions to manage {anomaly-jobs}.
Refer to {ml-docs}/setup.html[Set up ML features].

[[monitor-nginx-ml-add-jobs]]
=== Add nginx ML jobs

Add the nginx ML jobs from the nginx integration to start using anomaly detection:

. From the main {kib} menu, go to *Machine Learning*. Under *Anomaly Detection*, select *Jobs*.
. Select *Create job*.
. In the search bar, enter *nginx* and select *Nginx access logs [Logs Nginx]*.
. Under *Use preconfigured jobs*, select the *Nginx access logs* card.
. Select *Create jobs*.

Back on the *Anomaly Detection Jobs* page, you should see the nginx anomaly detection jobsâ€”`low_request_rate_nginx`, `source_ip_request_rate_nginx`, `source_ip_url_count_nginx`, `status_code_rate_nginx`, and `visitor_rate_nginx`.

[[monitor-nginx-ml-explore]]
=== Explore your anomaly detection job results

View your anomaly detection job results using the Anomaly Explorer or Single Metric Viewer found under *Anomaly Detection* in the Machine Learning menu.
The Anomaly Explorer shows the results from all or any combination of your nginx ML jobs.
The Single Metric Viewer focuses on a specific job.
These tools offer a comprehensive view of anomalies and help find patterns and irregularities across data points and time intervals.

Refer to {ml-docs}/ml-ad-view-results.html[View anomaly detection job results] for more on viewing and understanding your anomaly detection job results.

[[monitor-nginx-ml-alert]]
=== Set up alerts

With the nginx ML jobs detecting anomalies, you can set rules to generate alerts when your jobs meet specific conditions.
For example, you could set up a rule on the `low_request_rate_nginx` job to alert when low request rates hit a specific severity threshold.
When you get alerted, you can make sure your server isn't experiencing issues.

Refer to {ml-docs}/ml-configuring-alerts.html[Generating alerts for anomaly detection jobs] for more on setting these rules and generating alerts.
