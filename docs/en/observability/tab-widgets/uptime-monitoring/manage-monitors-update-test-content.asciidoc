If you're using project monitors, you can update journeys directly through code.
Then run the <<elastic-synthetics-push-command, `push` command>> to replace any existing monitors from this project in {kib} with new monitors that use the updated test.

NOTE: Updates are linked to a monitor's `id`. To update a monitor you must keep its `id` the same.

// end::managed[]

// tag::heartbeat[]

For inline monitors within your `heartbeat.yml` configuration file, update your monitors directly in that file.

// end::heartbeat[]

// tag::agent[]

For inline monitors you added to the {agent} Integration when you <<monitor-use, configured the monitor>>,
update your monitors directly in the integration UI.

// end::agent[]
