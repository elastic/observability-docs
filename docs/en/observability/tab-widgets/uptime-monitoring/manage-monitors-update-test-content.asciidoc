// tag::heartbeat[]

Update the tests in the directory specified in the `source.zip_url` you referenced in the {heartbeat} configuration file, and the changes will be reflected in the monitors.

If you're using inline monitors within your `heartbeat.yml` configuration file, update your monitors directly in that file.

// end::heartbeat[]

// tag::managed[]

If you're using project monitors, you can update journeys directly through code.
Then run the <<elastic-synthetics-push-command, `push` command>> to replace any existing monitors from this project in {kib} with new monitors that use the updated test.

NOTE: Updates are linked to a monitor's `id`. To update a monitor you must keep its `id` the same.

// end::managed[]

// tag::agent[]

Update the tests at the **Zip URL** you referenced in the {agent} Integration when you <<monitor-use, configured the monitor>>,
and the changes will be reflected in the monitors.

// end::agent[]
