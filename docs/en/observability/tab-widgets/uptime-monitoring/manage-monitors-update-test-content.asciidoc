If you're using project monitors, you can update journeys directly through code.
Then run the <<elastic-synthetics-push-command, `push` command>> to replace any existing monitors from this project in {kib} with new monitors that use the updated test.

NOTE: Updates are linked to a monitor's `id`. To update a monitor you must keep its `id` the same.
