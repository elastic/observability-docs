// tag::heartbeat[]

If you used {heartbeat} to <<uptime-set-up-choose, set up monitors>>, configure the monitor in `heartbeat.yml`. Use `source` to specify where to find the tests you want to run. For example:

[source,yml]
----
- name: Todos
  id: todos
  type: browser
  schedule: "@every 1m"
  params:
    target_url: "https://elastic.github.io/synthetics-demo/" <1>
  source:
    zip_url: <2>
      url: "https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" <3>
      folder: "todos/synthetics-tests" <4>
      username: "" <5>
      password: "" 
----
<1> The `params` section lets you define custom parameters to use in your script. In this example the `target_url` parameter is used by the project to determine which site to test.
<2> In this example, our library of synthetic tests is downloaded from the
remote zip endpoint for https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/tree/main/todos/synthetics-tests[our `todos` example]. 
<3> Note that the `url` refers to the endpoint where the test project exists.
<4> Folder refers to the relative path where the synthetic journey files are located. {heartbeat} will invoke the synthetics library on this folder.
<5> Username and password are blank here, but if provided, will be sent as HTTP Basic Authentication headers to the remote zip endpoint.

For a list of all available configuration options, see {heartbeat-ref}/monitor-browser-options.html[Browser options in the {heartbeat} documentation].

beta[] Configure each monitor directly in your test code using `monitor.use`.
The `monitor` API allows you to set unique options for each journey's monitor directly through code.
For example:

[source,js]
----
import { journey, step, monitor, expect } from '@elastic/synthetics';

journey('Ensure placeholder is correct', ({ page, params }) => {
  monitor.use({
    id: 'example-monitor',
    schedule: 10,
    throttling: {
      download: 10,
      upload: 5,
      latency: 100,
    },
  });
  step('Load the demo page', async () => {
    await page.goto('https://elastic.github.io/synthetics-demo/');
  });
  step('Assert placeholder text', async () => {
    const placeholderValue = await page.getAttribute(
      'input.new-todo',
      'placeholder'
    );
    expect(placeholderValue).toBe('What needs to be done?');
  });
});
----

For each journey, you can specify its `schedule` and the `locations` in which it runs.
When those options are not set, Synthetics will use the default values in the global configuration file.
For more details, see <<synthetics-configuration>>.

Here are all the available `monitor` configuration options:

`id` (`string`)::
A unique identifier for this monitor.
`name` (`string`)::
A human readable name for the monitor.
`tags` (`Array<string>`)::
A list of tags that will be sent with the monitor event. Tags are displayed in the {uptime-app} and allow you to search monitors by tag.
`schedule` (`number`)::
At which interval to run the test in seconds.
`enabled` (`boolean`)::
Enable or disable the monitor from running without deleting and recreating it.
`locations` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/locations/public-locations.ts#L28-L37[`Array<SyntheticsLocationsType>`])::
Where to deploy the monitor. Monitors can be deployed in multiple locations so that you can detect differences in availability and response times across those locations.
`throttling` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/common_types.ts#L194-L198[`ThrottlingOptions`])::
Control the monitor's download speeds, upload speeds, and latency to simulate your application's behavior on slower or laggier networks.
`screenshot` (https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/blob/{synthetics_version}/src/common_types.ts#L192[`ScreenshotOptions`])::
Control whether or not to capture screenshots. Options include `'on'`, `'off'`, or `'only-on-failure'`.
`privateLocations` (`Array<string>`)::
The <<private-locations,private locations>> to which the monitors will be deployed. These private locations refer to locations hosted and managed by you, whereas 
<<global-managed-testing-infrastructure,`locations`>> are hosted by Elastic. You can specify a private location using the location's name.

beta[] If you used {agent} to <<uptime-set-up-choose, set up monitors>>,
add a project when configuring the Elastic Synthetics integration
In *Monitor settings*, use the *Monitor Type* _Browser_.

Using the *Source Type* _Zip URL_, the fields should be set as follows:

// lint ignore params
* *Zip URL*: URL pointing to a zip file containing the test project.
* *Folder*: The folder within the zip file containing synthetics tests. This will be the working directory in which the synthetics agent runs. {heartbeat} will invoke the synthetics library in this folder. 
* *Params*: JSON formatted dynamic values that may be required by your specific tests. See <<synthetics-params-secrets>> for more information.
* *Zip URL Username* and *Zip URL Password*: HTTP Basic Authentication headers for the remote zip endpoint.

[NOTE]
==============
The example above downloads a library of synthetic tests from the remote zip endpoint for the git repository for https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/tree/main/todos/synthetics-tests[our `todos` example]. 

By using a git repository for synthetics journeys, you can benefit from a GitOps workflow, where your team would use `git` for deploying changes to synthetic monitors.
Others could, for example, update monitors through pull requests or use `git revert` to revert changes which broke a monitor.
Such a workflow allows you to manage tests more effectively.
==============

Click *Advanced Browser options* to see more ways to configure your monitor.

// * Use the *Selective tests* options to run a subset of all the tests in your project.
// Filter by journey names matching a pattern or filter by tags.
* Use the *Synthetics agent options* to provide fine-tuned configuration for the synthetics agent.
Read more about available options in <<synthetics-command-reference>>.
* Use *Throttling options* to control the monitor's network speed.
You can control the monitor's download and upload speeds and its latency to simulate your application's behavior on slower or laggier networks.

When applying the integration policy to an {agent} policy, make sure to select your dedicated synthetics agent policy.
