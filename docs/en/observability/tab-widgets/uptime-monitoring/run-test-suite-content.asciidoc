Copy and paste the path to your zip file into `heartbeat.yml`.

<1> The `params` section lets you define custom parameters to use in your script. In this example the `target_url` parameter is used by the test suite to determine which site to test.
<2> In this example, our library of synthetic tests is downloaded from the
remote zip endpoint for https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/tree/main/todos/synthetics-tests[our todos example]. 
<3> Note that the `url` refers to the endpoint where the test project exists.
<4> Folder refers to the relative path where the synthetic journey files are located. {heartbeat} will invoke the synthetics library on this folder.
<5> Username and password are blank here, but if provided, will be sent as HTTP Basic Authentication headers to the remote zip endpoint.

beta[] Add a test suite when configuring the Elastic Synthetics integration.
In *Monitor settings*, use the *Monitor Type* _Browser_.

Using the *Source Type* _Zip URL_, the fields should be set as follows:

* *Zip URL*: URL pointing to a zip file containing the test project.
* *Folder*: The folder within the zip file containing synthetics tests. This will be the working directory in which the synthetics agent runs. {heartbeat} will invoke the synthetics library in this folder. 
* *Params*: JSON formatted dynamic values that may be required by your specific tests. See <<synthetics-params-secrets>> for more information.
* *Zip URL Username* and *Zip URL Password*: HTTP Basic Authentication headers for the remote zip endpoint.

[NOTE]
==============
The example above downloads a library of synthetic tests from the remote zip endpoint for the git repository for https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/tree/main/todos/synthetics-tests[our todos example]. 

By using a git repository for synthetics journeys, you can benefit from a GitOps workflow, where your team would use `git` for deploying changes to synthetic monitors.
Others could, for example, update monitors through pull requests or use `git revert` to revert changes which broke a monitor.
Such a workflow allows you to manage tests more effectively.
==============

Click *Advanced Browser options* to see more ways to configure your monitor.

* Use the *Selective tests* options to run a subset of all the tests in your suite.
Filter by journey names matching a pattern or filter by tags.
* Use the *Synthetics agent options* to provide fine-tuned configuration for the synthetics agent.
Read more about available options in <<synthetics-command-reference>>.
* Use *Throttling options* to control the monitor's network speed.
You can control the monitor's download and upload speeds and its latency to simulate your application's behavior on slower or laggier networks.

When applying the integration policy to an {agent} policy, make sure to select your dedicated synthetics agent policy.
