To use a YAML file and the Elastic Synthetics library to add a
lightweight monitor on Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure:

. You'll need a project using `@elastic/synthetics`. You can use an existing project where you manage browser monitors, or you can create a new project using `elastic-synthetics init`.
. Add one or more `.yml` files to the project.
. Configure monitors in the `.yml` files. For example:

```yml
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  id: elastic-http
  name: Elastic HTTP check
  urls: ["https://elastic.co"]
  schedule: "@every 60s"
  tags: ["org:elastic"]
- type: tcp
  id: elastic-tcp
  name: Elastic TCP check
  hosts: ["elastic.co"]
  schedule: "@every 60s"
  tags: ["org:elastic"]
```

[IMPORTANT]
====
*This functionality is still in beta and not all {heartbeat} configuration options are supported.* If you attempt to push a project monitor with a configuration option that is not supported, the push will fail with an error.

After you have successfully added a new private location, close the _Private locations_ flyout to return
to the Monitor Management page. From there:

. Click **Add monitor**.
. Give your monitor a unique _Monitor name_.
. In _Monitor locations_, select your new private location, which will appear using the _Location name_
you provided and will have a "Private" badge next to its name.
