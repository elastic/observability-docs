If you <<synthetics-get-started-project,set up the monitor using projects>>,
you'll update the monitor in the project source and then `push` changes.

For lightweight monitors, make changes to the YAML file.

For browser monitors, you can update the configuration of one or more monitors:

* To update the configuration of an individual monitor, edit the journey directly in
  the JavaScript or TypeScript files, specifically the options in `monitor.use`.
* To update the configuration of _all_ monitors in a project, edit the
  <<synthetics-configuration-monitor, global synthetics configuration file>>.

To update the journey a browser monitor runs, edit the journey code directly and
<<synthetics-test-locally,test the updated journey locally>> to make sure it's valid.

After making changes to the monitors, run the <<elastic-synthetics-push-command,`push` command>>
to replace the existing monitors in {kib} with new monitors using the updated
configuration or journey code.

NOTE: Updates are linked to a monitor's `id`. To update a monitor you must keep its `id` the same.

If you <<synthetics-get-started-ui,set up the monitor using the {synthetics-app}>>,
you can update the monitor configuration of both lightweight and browser monitors
in the {synthetics-app}:

. Update the _Monitor settings_ as needed.
.. To update the journey used in a browser monitor, edit _Inline script_.
.. Make sure to click *Run test* to validate the new journey before updating the monitor.
