. On the **Add Elastic APM integration** page,
define the host and port where APM Server will listen.
Make a note of this value--you'll need it later.
+
TIP: Using Docker or Kubernetes?
Set the host to `0.0.0.0` to bind to all interfaces.

. Under **Agent authorization**, set a Secret token. This will be used to authorize requests from APM agents to the APM Server. Make a note of this value--you'll need it later.

. Click **Save and continue**.
This step takes a minute or two to complete. When it's done,
you'll have an agent policy that contains an APM integration policy for the configuration you just specified.

. To view the new policy, click **Agent policy 1**.

Any {agent}s assigned to this policy will collect APM data from your instrumented services.
