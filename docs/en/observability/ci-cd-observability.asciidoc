:figure-caption!:

To help administrators monitor and troubleshoot their CI/CD platform and help developers
increase the speed and reliability of their CI/CD pipelines, Elastic Observability
provides visibility in Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes.

To provide monitoring dashboards, alerting, and root cause analysis on pipelines, Elastic
works with the communities of the most popular CI/CD platforms to instrument tools with
OpenTelemetry.

[[ci-cd-architecture]]
== CI/CD observability architectures

Using the APM Server, connect all your OpenTelemetry native CI/CD tools directly to Elastic Observability.

A more advanced CI/CD observability architecture includes an OpenTelemetry Collector
deployed on the edge, next to the CI/CD tools. This architecture provides the following:

* Low latency between the CI/CD tools and the collector is particularly beneficial to
ephemeral tools like the otel-cli.
* The ability to route the observability signals to multiple backends in addition to
Elastic Observability.

[[ci-cd-monitoring]]
=== CI/CD platform monitoring and alerting

Elastic Observability helps CI/CD administrators monitor their platform by providing KPI dashboards
of CI systems.

The Jenkins health dashboards provide insights on the build executions, the failures, the
provisioning of build agents, the active and idle workers, or the JVM health.

[[ci-cd-troubleshooting]]
=== CI/CD platform troubleshooting

CI/CD administrators need to assess the impact of anomalies when troubleshooting platform problems quickly,
whether troubleshooting just one pipeline to much broader outages impacting many pipelines or the entire CI/CD platform.

Elastic Observability enables troubleshooting CI platform outages by providing visualizations of pipeline
executions as distributed traces, along with the capability to slice and dice pipeline executions in any dimension
to assess the nature and the impact of the outage.

In the following image, a Jenkins CI build failed, and its exceptions are reported as errors.
Select any of those errors to view the specific information. In this case, it's errors relating to
the CI agent that stopped.

The Errors overview screen provides a high-level view of the exceptions that CI builds catch.
Similar errors are grouped to quickly see which ones are affecting your services
and allow you to take action to rectify them.

[[ci-cd-developers]]
== Observability for developers

Development teams need to continuously optimize their ever-changing CI/CD pipelines to improve
their reliability while chasing faster pipelines. Visualizations of pipelines as distributed
traces help to document what’s happening and improve performance and reliability (flaky tests and pipelines).

Integrating with many popular CI/CD and DevOps tools like Maven or Ansible using OpenTelemetry, Elastic Observability
solves these problems by providing deep insights into the execution of CI/CD pipelines.

[discrete]
[[ci-cd-visibility]]
=== CI/CD pipeline visibility

The visualization of CI/CD pipelines as distributed traces in Elastic Observability provides
documentation and health indicators of all your pipelines.

The APM Service view in Elastic Observability provides a view of all your instrumented CI/CD
servers with insights on their KPIs.

[role="screenshot"]
.Jenkins servers in Elastic Observability
image::images/jenkins-servers.png[Jenkins servers view]

The Service page provides more granular insights into your CI/CD workflows by breaking down health
and performance metrics by pipeline. To quickly view which pipelines experience the most errors, are the
most frequently executed, or are the slowest, you can sort and filter the list.

[[ci-cd-pipelines]]
=== Individual pipeline visibility

Once you’ve identified the pipeline you want to troubleshoot, you can drill down to get more detailed
information about its performance over time. The pipeline summary shows a breakdown of duration and
failure rates across the pipeline’s individual builds and jobs to spot slowdowns or failures.

[role="screenshot"]
.Performance overview of a Jenkins pipeline in Elastic Observability
image::images/jenkins-pipeline-overview.png[Jenkins pipeline overview]

The pipelines and traditional jobs are instrumented automatically. If you spot a slow or failing
build and need to understand what’s happening, you can drill into the trace view of the build to look
for the high duration or errorful jobs. You can then dig into the details to understand the
source of the error.

[discrete]
[[ci-cd-configure-jenkins]]
==== Configure the OpenTelemetry plugin

The OpenTelemetry plugin needs to be configured to report data to an OpenTelemetry service.
In addition, you will need the endpoint of the OpenTelemetry service, the type of authentication,
and the access credentials.

. On the Jenkins UI, go to *Manage Jenkins* > *Configure System*.
. Go to the OpenTelemetry Plugin section.
. Configure your OpenTelemetry endpoint and authentication using the Elastic APM Server URL and the APM Server authentication:

* If using the Elastic APM secret token authorization, select a *Bearer Authentication Token*, and add the token
as a Jenkins secret text credential.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/configure-otel-plugin.png[Configure OTEL plugin]
+
* If using the Elastic API Key authorization, define the *Header Authentications*:
** Header name: `"Authorization"`
** Header value: a secret text credential with the value of `"ApiKey an_api_key"` (`an_api_key` is the value of the secret key)

. Go to *Add Visualisation Observability Backend* and define the URL for your {kib} server.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-url.png[Define Kibana URL]
+
. Finally, there are additional settings to configure:

* Endpoint certificates to use in communications.
* The service name and service namespace sent to the OpenTelemetry service.
* Timeouts and batch process times.
* Any steps you may want to omit from the data you send.
+
WARNING: You can export the OpenTelemetry configuration as environment variables to use them with other tools like otel-cli,
Ansible Otel plugin, and so on. If you enable this option, consider that you can potentially expose the credentials in
the console output.

To learn more about the integration of Jenkins with Elastic Observability, see https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry].

[[ci-cd-jenkins-dashbaords]]
==== Install Jenkins dashboards in {kib}

There are out of the box {kib} dashboards that help visualize some metrics for the CI/CD platform.

Using the {kibana-ref}/dashboard-import-api.html[Import API] or the {kib} UI, you
can https://github.com/jenkinsci/opentelemetry-plugin/tree/master/docs/dashboards/elastic[install dashboards]
that are compatible with version 7.12 or higher.

[discrete]
[[ci-cd-maven]]
=== Maven

The Maven OpenTelemetry extension integration provides comprehensive visibility into all of your Maven builds.
The extension generates traces for each build and performance metrics to help you understand which Maven goals
or Maven submodules are run the most, how often they fail, and how long they take to complete.

The context propagation from CI pipelines (Jenkins job or pipeline) is passed to the Maven build
through the `TRACEPARENT` and `TRACESTATE` environment variables that match the https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[W3C Trace Context specification].
Therefore, everything that happens in the CI platform is also shown in the traces.

You can configure your Maven project with the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/tree/main/maven-extension[Maven OpenTelemetry extension].
For example, you can add the following snippet to your pom.xml file:

[source,bash]
----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <extensions>
      <extension>
          <groupId>io.opentelemetry.contrib</groupId>
          <artifactId>opentelemetry-maven-extension</artifactId>
          <version>1.7.0-alpha</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>
  </build>
</project>
----

You can now trigger to send the Maven build reporting performance data to Elastic Observability by
passing the configuration details as environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://elastic-apm-server.example.com:8200"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer an_apm_secret_token"

mvn verify
----

You can instrument Maven builds without modifying the pom.xml file using the Maven
command line argument “-Dmaven.ext.class.path=...”

[source,bash]
----
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://elastic-apm-server.example.com:8200"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer an_apm_secret_token"

mvn -Dmaven.ext.class.path=path/to/opentelemetry-maven-extension.jar verify
----

You can also trigger your Maven builds from the CI platform and visualize the end-to-end
pipeline execution in Elastic Observability, including the detailed steps of your CI
pipeline and the Maven build.

When invoking Maven builds with Jenkins, it’s unnecessary to use environment variables
to configure the Maven build (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT…`) to rely on the Jenkins capability
to inject OpenTelemetry configuration as environment variables. For more details, refer to <<ci-cd-install-jenkins>>.

[discrete]
[[ci-cd-ansible]]
=== Ansible

The Ansible OpenTelemetry plugin integration provides visibility into all your
Ansible playbooks. The plugin generates traces for each run and performance metrics to help
you understand which Ansible tasks or roles are run the most, how often they
fail, and how long they take to complete.

You can configure your Ansible playbooks with the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/opentelemetry_callback.html[Ansible OpenTelemetry callback plugin].
It’s required to install the Opentelemetry python libraries and configure the callback
as stated in the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/opentelemetry_callback.html#examples[examples] section.

The context propagation from the Jenkins job or pipeline is passed to the Ansible run. Therefore,
everything that happens in the CI is also shown in the traces.

[[ci-cd-otel-cli]]
=== Otel cli

https://github.com/equinix-labs/otel-cli[otel-cli] is a command-line tool for sending OpenTelemetry
traces, which is useful if instrumenting your scripts explicitly when no other implicit
integration is in place.

Using the otel-cli wrapper, you can configure your build scripts implemented in shell, make, or
another scripting language. For example, instrumenting the Makefile below with otel-cli helps
visualize every command in each goal as spans.

[source,bash]
----
# see https://blog.container-solutions.com/tagging-docker-images-the-right-way

NAME   := acmecorp/foo
TAG    := $$(git log -1 --pretty=%!H(MISSING))
IMG    := ${NAME}:${TAG}
LATEST := ${NAME}:latest
 
build:
  @otel-cli exec \
    --name 'docker build' \
    docker build -t ${IMG} .
  @otel-cli exec \
    --name 'docker tag' \
    docker tag ${IMG} ${LATEST}
 
push:
  @otel-cli exec \
    --name 'docker push' \
    --attrs "http.url=https://docker.elastic.dev" \
    docker push ${NAME}
 
login:
  @otel-cli exec \
    --name 'docker login' \
    --attrs 'rpc.system=grpc' \
    docker login -u ${DOCKER_USER} -p ${DOCKER_PASS}
----

To invoke shell scripts that use otel-cli for tracing:

[source,bash]
----
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="elastic-apm-server.example.com:8200"
make login build push
----

[[ci-cd-concourse-ci]]
=== Concourse CI

To configure Concourse CI to send traces, refer to the https://concourse-ci.org/tracing.html[tracing] docs.
In the Concourse configuration, you just need to define `CONCOURSE_TRACING_OTLP_ADDRESS`
and `CONCOURSE_TRACING_OTLP_HEADERS`.

[source,bash]
----
CONCOURSE_TRACING_OTLP_ADDRESS=elastic-apm-server.example.com:8200
CONCOURSE_TRACING_OTLP_HEADERS=Authorization=Bearer your-secret-token
----

Context propagation is supported; therefore, you can benefit from the integrations described above.

Once Concourse CI tracing is configured, Concourse CI pipeline executions are
reported in Elastic Observability.

[role="screenshot"]
.A Concourse CI pipeline execution in Elastic Observability
image::images/jenkins-concourse.png[Concourse CI pipeline execution]

The Concourse CI doesn’t report health metrics through OpenTelemetry. However, you can use the
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/spanmetricsprocessor#span-metrics-processor[OpenTelemetry Collector Span Metrics Processor]
to derive pipeline execution traces into KPI metrics like throughput and the error rate
of pipelines.
