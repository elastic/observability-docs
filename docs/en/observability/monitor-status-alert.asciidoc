[[status-alert-conditions]]
== Conditions

You can specify the following thresholds for your rule.

|=== 

| *Status check* | Receive alerts when a monitor goes down a specified number of
times within a time range (seconds, minutes, hours, or days).

| *Availability* | Receive alerts when a monitor goes below a specified availability
threshold within a time range (days, weeks, months, or years).

|=== 

Let's create a rule for any monitor that shows `Down` more than three times in 10 minutes.
We'll choose to only be notified on an alert status change so that we're not flooded with alert notifications.
This means actions are not repeated when an alert remains active across checks. Actions will run only when the
alert status changes.

This rule covers all the monitors you have running. You can use a query to specify
specific monitors, and you can also have different conditions for each one.

The final step when creating a rule is to select one or more actions to take when
the alert is triggered.

[[action-types-status]]
== Action types

You can extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are {kib} services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <<configure-uptime-alert-connectors,Settings>> page.
