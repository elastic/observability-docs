This guide describes how to:

* Monitor logs and infrastructure metrics from systems and services across your organization
* Monitor Nginx logs and metrics using the Nginx integration

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {forum}[discuss forum].

[[logs-metrics-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

// tag::monitoring-prereqs[]
To follow the steps in this guide, you need an {stack} deployment that includes:

* {es} for storing and searching data
* {kib} for visualizing and managing data
* Kibana user with `All` privileges on {fleet} and Integrations. Since many
Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the Kibana privileges
in all spaces.
* Integrations Server (included by default in every {ess} deployment)

To get started quickly, spin up a deployment of our hosted {ess}. The {ess} is
available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. {ess-trial}[Try it out for free].

[[add-system-integration]]
== Step 1: Add the {agent} System integration

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query
data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and
more. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your
infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy you can update to add
integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

In this step, add the System integration to monitor host logs and metrics.

. Go to the {kib} home page and click **Add integrations**.

--

. In the query bar, search for **System** and select the integration to see more
details about it.

. Click **Add System**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
Make sure that **Collect logs from System instances** and
**Collect metrics from System instances** are turned on.

. Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for
your host. For example, if you're  deploying {agent} on macOS hosts, you
need to add a new path to the _System syslog logs_ section by clicking
**Add row** and specifying `/var/log/system.log`.

--

. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains a system integration policy
for the configuration you just specified.
+

--

. In the popup, click **Add {agent} to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
flyout.
+
TIP: If you accidentally close the popup, go to **{fleet} > Agents**, then click
**Add agent** to access the flyout.

[discrete]
[[add-agent-to-fleet]]
== Step 2: Install and run an {agent} on your machine

The **Add agent** flyout has two options: **Enroll in {fleet}** and
**Run standalone**. The default is to enroll the agents in {fleet}, as this
reduces the amount of work on the person managing the hosts by providing
a centralized management tool in {kib}.

. Skip the **Select enrollment token** step. The enrollment token you need is
already selected.
+
NOTE: The enrollment token is specific to the {agent} policy that you just
created. When you run the command to enroll the agent in {fleet}, you will pass
in the enrollment token.

. Download, install, and enroll the {agent} on your host by selecting
your host operating system and following the **Install {agent} on your host**
step.
+
--
[role="screenshot"]

--
+
It takes about a minute for {agent} to enroll in {fleet}, download the
configuration specified in the policy you just created, and start collecting
data.

[discrete]
[[view-data]]
== Step 3: Monitor host logs and metrics

. Verify that data is flowing. Wait until agent enrollment is confirmed and
incoming data is received, then click **View assets** to access dashboards
related to the System integration.
+
--

--

. Choose a dashboard that is related to the operating system of your
monitored system. Dashboards are available for Microsoft Windows systems
and Unix-like systems (for example, Linux and macOS).
+
--
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-agent-system-integration-visualizations.png[Agent list of visualizations]
--

. Open the **[Metrics System] Host overview** dashboard to view performance metrics
from your host system.
+

You can hover over any visualization to adjust its settings, or click the
**Edit** button to make changes to the dashboard. To learn more, refer to
{kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[Dashboard and visualizations].

[[add-nginx-integration]]
== Step 4: Monitor Nginx logs and metrics
[discrete]

Next, add an Nginx integration to the policy used by your agent.

NOTE: For these steps, we assume that you have `nginx` running on your host, and
want to collect logs and metrics from it. If not, you can skip this part of the
guide.

. In {kib}, go to the **Integrations** page.

. In the query bar, search for **Nginx** and select the integration to see more
details about it.

. Click **Add Nginx**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.

. Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for
your host. You may need to change the **Paths** settings.

. Under **Where to add this integration**, select *Existing hosts*, then select
the agent policy you created earlier. That way, you can deploy the change to
the agent that's already running.

. When you're done, click **Save and continue**, then **Save and deploy changes**.
// lint ignore nginx-1
. To see the updated policy, click the agent policy link.
+
The newly added Nginx integration should appear on the **Integrations** tab in
your agent policy.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-nginx.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with nginx-1 data source]
+
Any {agent}s assigned to this policy will collect logs and metrics from the
Nginx server and the host, along with system logs and uptime data.

. To view the data, go to **Management > {fleet}**, then click the
**Data streams** tab.

. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
to the data stream.

== What's next?

* Monitor the status and response times of applications and services in real time using the {uptime-app}.
You can monitor the availability of network endpoints via HTTP, TCP, ICMP or Browser monitors. Get started in <<monitor-uptime-synthetics>>.

* Now that data is streaming into the {stack}, take your investigation to a
deeper level! Use https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic {observability}]
to unify your logs, infrastructure metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
https://www.elastic.co/security[{elastic-sec}]. Adding endpoint protection is
just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
{observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Create alerts] and find out about
problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use {ml} to
{observability-guide}/inspect-log-anomalies.html[detect anomalies].

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
other hosts by deploying {agent}s across your infrastructure!
