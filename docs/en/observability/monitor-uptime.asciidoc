= Uptime monitoring

[NOTE]
=====
If you haven't already, please install and configure {heartbeat} to populate
the {uptime-app} with data. For more information, see <<ingest-uptime,Ingest uptime data>>.
=====

The {uptime-app} in {kib} enables you to monitor the availability and response times
of applications and services in real-time, and detect problems before they affect users.
You can monitor the status of network endpoints via HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.

The {uptime-app} uses {heartbeat} to check the status of your services
and applications periodically. To monitor services for their availability with active
probing, deploy {heartbeat} as part of a monitoring service that runs on
a separate machine, and outside of the network where the services that you want
to monitor are running.

To view the {uptime-app}, go to *Observability > Uptime*.
