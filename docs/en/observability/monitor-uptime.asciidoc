[[monitor-uptime]]
= Monitor uptime data

[NOTE]
=====
If you haven't already, you need to install and configure {heartbeat} to populate
the {uptime-app} with data. For more information, see <<ingest-uptime,Ingest uptime data>>.
=====

The {uptime-app} in {kib} enables you to monitor the availability and response times
of applications and services in real time, and detect problems before they affect users.
You can monitor the status of network endpoints via HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.

The {uptime-app} uses the {heartbeat} module to check the status of your services
and applications periodically. So that you can monitor services for their availability with active
probing, you can deploy the {heartbeat} module as part of a monitoring service that runs on
a separate machine, and outside of the network where the services that you want
to monitor are running.

To view the {uptime-app}, in the side navigation, expand *Observability*, and then click *Uptime*.
