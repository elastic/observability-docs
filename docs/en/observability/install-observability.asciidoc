To use Elastic Observability, you need {es} for storing and searching your
data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing it.

Alternatively, you can install and self manage {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[{es}],
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[Kibana], and
{apm-server-ref-v}/installing.html[APM server].
First see the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about
supported operating systems and product compatibility. We recommend you use the same
version of {es}, {kib}, and APM Server.
