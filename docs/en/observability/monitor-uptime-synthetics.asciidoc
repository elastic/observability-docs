Synthetic monitors go beyond classic end-to-end tests and monitoring practices to ensure that your software continues to work as expected in many conditions. 

Even the most thorough end-to-end tests can't prove your software works because you can't validate all possible states of your application.
And while improving your monitoring practices could help, it might not be sufficient for features that don't get enough traffic.

Synthetic monitoring solves these problems.
Start by building _synthetic journeys_, end-to-end tests executed by a real browser that you can run both on your machine and CI.
Then, use Kibana to create _synthetic monitors_ to periodically run those synthetic journeys against any desired deployment environments (including production) and help you catch and fix problems before your users notice them.
// Elastic's machine learning capabilities can also automatically detect anomalies and send out alerts to your team.

The {uptime-app} in {kib} includes two types of synthetic monitoring:

* Browser checks
* Lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks

== Browser checks

beta[] Real browser synthetic monitoring enables you to test critical actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment. You can view each synthetic monitoring journey
in the {uptime-app} side-by-side with your other <<monitor-uptime,Uptime monitors>>. The result is rich, consistent, and repeatable
data that you can trend and alert on.

For example, test popular user journeys, like logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking
out -- actions that need to work for your users consistently.

Alerting ensures that any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed before impacting your bottom line or customer
experience.

== Lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks

You can monitor the status of network endpoints using lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.
