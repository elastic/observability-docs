== Synthetic monitoring

beta[] Real browser synthetic monitoring allows you to test critical actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment. You can view each Synthetic monitoring journey
in the {uptime-app} side-by-side with your other <<monitor-uptime,Uptime monitors>>. The result is rich, consistent, and repeatable
data that you can trend and alert on.

For example, test popular user journeys, like logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking
out -- actions that need to work for your users consistently.

Alerting ensures that any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed before impacting your bottom line or customer
experience.

== Uptime monitoring

The {uptime-app} in {kib} enables you to monitor the availability and response times
of applications and services in real time, and detect problems before they affect users.

You can monitor the status of network endpoints using HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.
