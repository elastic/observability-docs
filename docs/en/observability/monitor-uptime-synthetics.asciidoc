Synthetic monitoring extends traditional end-to-end testing techniques because it allows your tests to run continuously on the cloud.
With Elastic's Synthetic Monitoring product, you can assert that your application continues to work after a deployment by reusing the same journeys that you used to validate the software on your machine.

You can use synthetic monitors to detect bugs caused by invalid states you couldn't anticipate and didn't write tests for.
Synthetic monitors can also help you catch bugs in features that don't get enough traffic by allowing you to periodically simulate users' actions.

The {uptime-app} in {kib} includes two types of synthetic monitoring:

* <<monitoring-synthetics>>
* <<monitoring-uptime>>

== Browser checks

beta[] Real browser synthetic monitoring enables you to test critical actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment. You can view each synthetic monitoring journey
in the {uptime-app} side-by-side with your other <<monitor-uptime,Uptime monitors>>. The result is rich, consistent, and repeatable
data that you can trend and alert on.

For example, test popular user journeys, like logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking
out -- actions that need to work for your users consistently.

Alerting ensures that any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed before impacting your bottom line or customer
experience.

== Lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks

You can monitor the status of network endpoints using lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.
