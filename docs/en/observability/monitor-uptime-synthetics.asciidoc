== Browser checks

beta[] Real browser synthetic monitoring enables you to test critical actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment. You can view each synthetic monitoring journey
in the {uptime-app} side-by-side with your other <<monitor-uptime,Uptime monitors>>. The result is rich, consistent, and repeatable
data that you can trend and alert on.

For example, test popular user journeys, like logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking
out -- actions that need to work for your users consistently.

Alerting ensures that any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed before impacting your bottom line or customer
experience.
