Use these advanced considerations when using the {synthetics-app}
for large and complex use cases.

[[synthetics-no-ccs-ccr]]
= Do not use the {synthetics-app} with CCS/CCR

In complex environments it's common to have multiple task-specific {stack}
deployments with one  centralized overview cluster using CCS or CCR to centralize {kib}
dashboards and apps. *Do not use this pattern with the {synthetics-app}*.
Instead, configure your synthetic monitors directly on the {kib} instance where you
want to view and manage them.

You may, however, use Dashboards and the Discover feature with CCS to view `synthetics-*` indices.

The {synthetics-app} does _not_ work with CCS/CCR because it would limit the rich
user experience that the {synthetics-app} provides.
Unlike the majority of {kib} apps, the {synthetics-app} relies heavily on state stored
in {kib} shared objects in order to provide a rich user experience.
Because {kib} saved objects cannot be shared via CCS/CCR, the {synthetics-app}
will not show any user data even if CCS/CCR is configured.

[[synthetics-tagging]]
= Manage large numbers of Synthetic monitors with tags

When managing larger numbers of synthetic monitors, use tags to keep them organized.
Many of the views in the {synthetics-app} are tag-aware and can group data by tag.

[[synthetics-custom-dashboards]]
= Create custom dashboards

If the {synthetics-app} does not provide a UI for your exact needs, you can use 
{kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[{kib} dashboards] to build custom visualizations.
For a complete accounting of fields used by the {synthetics-app}, refer to
{heartbeat-ref}/exported-fields.html[{heartbeat}'s exported fields].
