[[synthetics-lightweight]]
= Configure lightweight monitors

In the {synthetics-app} you can monitor the status of network endpoints using the following lightweight checks:

* *HTTP*: Monitor your website. The HTTP monitor checks to make sure specific endpoints return the correct
  status code and display the correct text.
* *ICMP*: Check the availability of your hosts. The ICMP monitor uses ICMP (v4 and v6) Echo
  Requests to check the network reachability of the hosts you are pinging. This will tell you whether the
  host is available and connected to the network, but doesn't tell you if a service on the host is running or
  not.
* *TCP*: Monitor the services running on your hosts. The TCP monitor checks individual ports
  to make sure the service is accessible and running.

Lightweight monitors can be configured using either the <<synthetics-lightweight-ui>>
or <<synthetics-lightweight-projects>>.

[[synthetics-lightweight-ui]]
= {synthetics-app}

To use the UI in the {synthetics-app}, go to the {synthetics-app} in {kib} to create and configure monitors.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to <<synthetics-get-started-ui>>.

[[synthetics-lightweight-projects]]
= {project-monitors-cap}

To use YAML files in to create {project-monitors}, <<synthetics-get-started-project,set up a project>>
and configure monitors in YAML files in the `lightweight` directory.

In each YAML file, define a set of `monitors` to check your remote hosts.
Each `monitor` item is an entry in a YAML list and begins with a dash (`-`).
You can define the type of monitor to use, the hosts to check, and other
optional settings.

The following example configures three monitors checking via the `http`, `icmp`, and `tcp`
protocols and demonstrates how to use TCP Echo response verification:

[source,yaml]
----
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  name: Todos Lightweight
  id: todos-lightweight
  urls: "https://elastic.github.io/synthetics-demo/"
  schedule: '@every 1m'
- type: icmp
  id: ping-myhost
  name: My Host Ping
  hosts: "myhost"
  schedule: '@every 5m'
- type: tcp
  id: myhost-tcp-echo
  name: My Host TCP Echo
  hosts: "myhost:777"  # default TCP Echo Protocol
  check.send: "Check"
  check.receive: "Check"
  schedule: '@every 60s'

[[synthetics-monitor-options]]
There are some common monitor configuration options that are the same for all lightweight monitor types.
For a complete list, refer to <<synthetics-lightweight-common-options>>.

Each monitor type also has additional configuration options that are specific to that type.
Refer to:

* <<synthetics-lightweight-http>>
* <<synthetics-lightweight-icmp>>
* <<synthetics-lightweight-tcp>>

The `tcp` and `http` monitor types both support SSL/TLS and some proxy settings.

[[synthetics-lightweight-common-options]]
== Common options

You can specify the following options when defining a synthetic monitor in any location.
These options are the same for all monitors. Each monitor type has additional configuration
options that are specific to that monitor type.

// Reference table
include::synthetics-reference/lightweight-config/common.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-http]]
== HTTP options

The options described here configure Synthetics to connect via HTTP and
optionally verify that the host returns the expected response.

Valid options for HTTP monitors include <<synthetics-lightweight-common-options,all common options>>
and the following HTTP-specific options:

// Reference table
include::synthetics-reference/lightweight-config/http.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-icmp]]
== ICMP options

The options described here configure Synthetics to use ICMP (v4 and v6) Echo
Requests to check the configured hosts. On most platforms you must execute
Synthetics with elevated permissions to perform ICMP pings.

On Linux, regular users may perform pings if the right file capabilities are set. Run
`sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip /path/to/heartbeat` to  grant Synthetics ping capabilities on Linux.
Alternatively, you can grant ping permissions to the user being used to run Synthetics.
To grant ping permissions in this way, run `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range='myuserid myuserid'`.

Other platforms may require Synthetics to run as root or administrator to execute pings.

Valid options for ICMP monitors include <<synthetics-lightweight-common-options,all common options>>
and the following ICMP-specific options:

// Reference table
include::synthetics-reference/lightweight-config/icmp.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-tcp]]
== TCP options

The options described here configure Synthetics to connect via TCP and
optionally verify the endpoint by sending and/or receiving a custom payload.

Valid options for TCP monitors include <<synthetics-lightweight-common-options,all common options>>
and the following TCP-specific options:

// Reference table
include::synthetics-reference/lightweight-config/tcp.asciidoc[]

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-data-types]]
== Data types reference

Values of configuration settings are interpreted as required by Synthetics.
If a value can't be correctly interpreted as the required type - for example a
string is given when a number is required - Synthetics will fail to start up.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-data-bool]]
=== Boolean

Boolean values can be either `true` or `false`. Alternative names for `true` are
`yes` and `on`. Instead of `false` the values `no` and `off` can be used.

[source,yaml]
-----
enabled: true
disabled: false
-----

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-data-numbers]]
=== Number

Number values require you to enter the number _without_ single or
double quotes. 

[source,yaml]
-----
integer: 123
negative: -1
float: 5.4
-----

NOTE: Some settings only support a restricted number range.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-data-string]]
=== String

In http://www.yaml.org[YAML], multiple styles of string definitions are supported:
double-quoted, single-quoted, unquoted.

The double-quoted style is specified by surrounding the string with `"`. This
style provides support for escaping unprintable characters using `\`, but comes
at the cost of having to escape `\` and `"` characters.

The single-quoted style is specified by surrounding the string with `'`. This
style supports no escaping (use `''` to quote a single quote). Only printable
characters can be used when using this form.

Unquoted style requires no quotes, but does not support any escaping and can't
include any symbol that has a special meaning in YAML.

NOTE: Single-quoted style is recommended when defining regular expressions,
event format strings, windows file paths, or non-alphabetical symbolic characters.

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-data-duration]]
=== Duration

Durations require a numeric value with optional fraction and required unit.
Valid time units are `ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. Sometimes features based
on durations can be disabled by using zero or negative durations.

[source,yaml]
-----
duration1: 2.5s
duration2: 6h
duration_disabled: -1s
-----

[discrete]
[[synthetics-lightweight-data-regex]]
=== Regular expression

Regular expressions are special strings that are compiled into regular
expressions at load time.

As regular expressions and YAML use `\` for escaping
characters in strings, it's highly recommended to use single quoted strings when
defining regular expressions. When single quoted strings are used, the `\` character
is not interpreted by YAML parser as an escape symbol.
