= Advanced lightweight monitors

// not sure what should be included here, but this is from existing

To use a YAML file and the Elastic Synthetics library to add a
lightweight monitor:

. You'll need a project using `@elastic/synthetics`. You can use an existing project where you manage browser monitors, or you can create a new project using `elastic-synthetics init`.
. Add one or more `.yml` files to the project.
. Configure monitors in the `.yml` files. For example:

```yml
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  id: elastic-http
  name: Elastic HTTP check
  urls: ["https://elastic.co"]
  schedule: "@every 60s"
  tags: ["org:elastic"]
- type: tcp
  id: elastic-tcp
  name: Elastic TCP check
  hosts: ["elastic.co"]
  schedule: "@every 60s"
  tags: ["org:elastic"]
```

[IMPORTANT]
====
*This functionality is still in beta and not all {heartbeat} configuration options are supported.* If you attempt to push a project monitor with a configuration option that is not supported, the push will fail with an error.
