Index lifecycle policies allow you to automate the lifecycle of your profiling indices as they grow and age. A default policy is applied, but you can customize it based on your business needs.

[[profiling-ilm-default-policy]]
== Default policy

The default Universal Profiling index lifecycle policy includes the following rollover and delete definitions:


* **Rollover**: Rollover prevents a single index from growing too large and optimizes indexing and search performance. After an age or size metric threshold is met, a new index is created and all subsequent updates are written to the new index.

* **Delete**: The delete phase permanently removes the index after a time threshold is met.

The following table lists the default thresholds for rollover and delete:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Rollover
|Warm tier
|Delete

| after 30 days or 50 GB
| after 30 days
| after 60 days


|===

NOTE: The {ref}/ilm-rollover.html#_rollover_condition_blocks_phase_transition[rollover condition blocks phase transitions] which means that indices are kept 30 days *after* rollover on the hot tier.

To view the Universal Profiling index lifecycle policy in {kib}, navigate to *{stack-manage-app}* → *Index Lifecycle Management*, and search for `profiling`.


TIP: Default {ilm-init} policies can change between minor versions. This is not considered a breaking change as index management should continually improve and adapt to new features.

== Configure a custom index lifecycle policy

[discrete]
[[profiling-ilm-custom-policy-create-policy]]
=== Step 1: Create an index lifecycle policy

. Navigate to **{stack-manage-app}** → **Index Lifecycle Policies**.

. Click **Create policy**.
. Name your new policy, for example `custom-profiling-policy`. 
. Customize the policy to your liking.
. Click **Save policy**.

TIP: See {ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[Manage the index lifecycle] to learn more about {ilm-init} policies.

[[profiling-ilm-custom-policy-apply-policy]]
=== Step 2: Apply the index lifecycle policy

To apply your new index lifecycle policy for Universal Profiling, create a new component template named `profiling-ilm@custom`.

NOTE: To apply a custom {ilm-init} policy, you must name the component template `profiling-ilm@custom`. Other names are not supported.


. From the *Index Management* page, select the **Component Template** tab and click **Create component template**.

. Enter `profiling-ilm@custom` as the name and click **Next**.

. In **Index settings**, set the {ilm-init} policy name created in the previous step:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "name": "custom-profiling-policy"
  }
}
----
. Continue to the **Review** step, and select the *Request* tab. Your request should look similar to the following image.


If it does, click **Create component template**.

[[profiling-ilm-custom-policy-rollover]]
=== Step 3: Rollover indices

To confirm that Universal Profiling is now using the new index template and {ilm-init} policy, navigate to **{dev-tools-app}** and run the following:

[source,bash]
----
GET _ilm/policy/custom-profiling-policy <1>
----
<1> The name of the custom {ilm-init} policy chosen in <<profiling-ilm-custom-policy-create-policy,Step 1>>.


If the custom policy is already applied, the result should include the following:

[source,json]
----
{
    "in_use_by": {
      "indices": [
        ...
      ],
      "data_streams": [
        ...
        "profiling-events-all",
        ...
      ],
      "composable_templates": [
        "profiling-stackframes",
        "profiling-symbols-global",
        "profiling-metrics",
        "profiling-stacktraces",
        "profiling-executables",
        "profiling-hosts",
        "profiling-events"
      ]
    }
}
----

If the result is empty, the custom {ilm-init} policy is not yet in use. New {ilm-init} policies only take effect when new indices are created, so either wait for a rollover to occur (usually after 30 days or when the index size reaches 50 GB), or force a rollover using the {ref}/indices-rollover-index.html[{es} rollover API]:


[source,bash]

After the rollover, the custom {ilm-init} policy will be applied to new indices and data streams.
