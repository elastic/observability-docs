NOTE: To use the Elastic Synthetics integration, see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent[8.3 documentation]. The Elastic Synthetics integration is similar to the {uptime-app} approach described above, but contains fewer configuration options and does not allow you to run monitors against Elastic's global managed testing locations.

[[uptime-set-up-prereq]]
== Prerequisites

You can now create monitors directly in the {uptime-app}.
To try this beta functionality, first you need to enable Monitor Management in {kib}:

. Go to **{observability}** -> **Uptime**.
. Click **Monitor Management**.
. Review the terms and conditions and click **Enable** to start using Monitor Management.

[IMPORTANT]
======
To enable Monitor Management, you must be logged into {kib} as a user with
the following privileges:

* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster privileges]: `monitor`, `read_ilm`, `read_pipeline`, and at least one of `manage_own_api_key`, `manage_security`, or `manage_api_key`
* {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges] for `synthetics-*`: `view_index_metadata`, `create_doc`, `auto_configure`
======

You should also decide where you want to run the monitors before getting started:

[[private-locations]]
* *Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure*:
  With Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure, you can create and run monitors in multiple
  locations without having to manage your own infrastructure.
  Elastic takes care of software updates and capacity planning for you.
* *Private locations*: Private locations allow you to run monitors from your own premises.
  To use private locations will must create a private location before continuing.
  For step-by-step instructions, refer to <<synthetics-private-location>>.

[[uptime-set-up-app-add-monitors]]
== Add monitors

To use the {uptime-app}'s Monitor Management UI to add a lightweight monitor on
Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure:

. Go to the **Monitor Management** page.
. Click **Add monitor**.
. In _Monitor locations_, select one or more locations.
. Choose a _Monitor type_ and configure the monitor as needed.
. Click **Save monitor**.

[NOTE]
====
If you've <<synthetics-private-location,added a private location>>,
you'll see your new private location in the list of _Monitor locations_.
The new private location will have the _Location name_ you provided and
a "Private" badge next to its name.

[[uptime-app-view-in-kibana]]
== View in {kib}

// tag::next[]
{agent} is now sending synthetic monitoring data to the {stack}.
Navigate to the {uptime-app} in {kib}, where you can see screenshots of each run,
set up alerts in case of test failures, and more.

If a test does fail (shown as `down` in the {uptime-app}), you'll be able to view the step script that failed,
any errors, and a stack trace.
See <<synthetics-visualize>> for more information.
