Many requests go into building visualizations in {kib}.
For example, to render visualizations in the {uptime-app}, {kib} needs to request a list of all your monitors,
data about the availability of each monitor over time, and more.
If something goes wrong, the Inspect view can help you report an issue and troubleshoot with Elastic support.

Inspecting requests is available for the following apps:

* APM
* Uptime
* {user-experience}
