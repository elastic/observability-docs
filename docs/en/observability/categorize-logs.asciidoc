[[categorize-logs]]
= Categorize log entries

Application log events are often unstructured and contain variable data. Many
log messages are the same or very similar, so classifying them can reduce
millions of log lines into just a few categories.

Within the {logs-app}, the *Categories* page helps you identify patterns in
your log events quickly. Instead of manually identifying similar logs, the logs categorization view lists
log events that have been grouped based on their messages and formats so that you can take action
quicker.

[[create-log-categories]]
== Create log categories

Create a machine learning job to categorize log messages automatically. Machine learning will observe
the static parts of the message, cluster similar messages, and classify them into message categories.

1. Select *Categories*. Then you'll be prompted to use machine learning, which will carry out the log rate categorizations.
2. Choose a time range for the machine learning analysis.
3. Add the Indices that contain the logs you want to analyze.
4. Click *Create ML job*.

You're now ready to explore your log categories.

[[analyze-log-categories]]
== Analyze log categories

The *Categories* page lists various log categories from
`elasticsearch.server` logs, along with the maximum anomaly score on the right.

The highlighted log category has a very high anomaly score, and looks like this:

[source,console-result]
----------------------------------
⁕type⁕server⁕timestamp⁕level⁕component⁕o.e.m.j.JvmGcMonitorService⁕cluster.name
⁕elasticsearch⁕node.name⁕message⁕gc⁕overhead⁕spent⁕collecting⁕in⁕the⁕last⁕cluster.uuid⁕
jx_Bw17eT_OQshT2IrDuzg⁕node.id⁕
----------------------------------

Here is an example of a log line in this category:

[source,console-result]
----------------------------------
[elasticsearch.server][INFO] {"type": "server", "timestamp": "2020-01-31T22:51:03,633Z",
"level": "INFO", "component": "o.e.m.j.JvmGcMonitorService", "cluster.name": "elasticsearch",
"node.name": "elasticsearch-master-0", "message": "[gc][411617] overhead, spent [316ms]
collecting in the last [1s]", "cluster.uuid": "jx_Bw17eT_OQshT2IrDuzg", "node.id": "JwIW6wI2T6WsgpoaUB3eaA" }
----------------------------------

The anomaly indicates an unexpected slow down of garbage collection runs, which could indicate low
JVM memory problems impacting {es} performance.

You may have already been alerted about low JVM memory through the monitoring setup. In that case,
logs categorization makes it easier to find the root cause by indicating the above category
of `stopped garbage collection`.
