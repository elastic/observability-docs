[[categorize-logs]]
= Categorize log entries

Application log events are often unstructured and contain variable data. Many
log messages are the same or very similar, so classifying them can reduce
millions of log lines into just a few categories.

Within the {logs-app}, the *Categories* page enables you to identify patterns in
your log events quickly. Instead of manually identifying similar logs, the logs 
categorization view lists log events that have been grouped based on their 
messages and formats so that you can take action quicker.

NOTE: This feature makes use of {ml} {anomaly-jobs}. To set up jobs, you must
have `all` {kib} feature privileges for *{ml-app}*. Users that have full or
read-only access to {ml-features} within a {kib} space can view the results of
_all_ {anomaly-jobs} that are visible in that space, even if they do not have
access to the source indices of those jobs. You must carefully consider who is
given access to {ml-features}; {anomaly-job} results may propagate field values
that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the results. For
more details, refer to {ml-docs}/setup.html[Set up {ml-features}].

[[create-log-categories]]
== Create log categories

Create a {ml} job to categorize log messages automatically. {ml-cap} observes
the static parts of the message, clusters similar messages, classifies them into
message categories, and detects unusually high message counts in the categories.

// lint ignore ml
1. Select *Categories*, and you are prompted to use {ml} to create 
   log rate categorizations.
2. Choose a time range for the {ml} analysis. By default, the {ml} job analyzes 
   log messages no older than four weeks and continues indefinitely.
3. Add the indices that contain the logs you want to examine.
4. Click *Create ML job*. The job is created, and it starts to run. It takes a few 
   minutes for the {ml} robots to collect the necessary data. After the job 
   processed the data, you can view the results.

[[analyze-log-categories]]
== Analyze log categories

The *Categories* page lists all the log categories from the selected indices. 
You can filter the categories by indices. The screenshot below shows the 
categories from the `elastic.agent` log.

The category row contains the following information: 

* message count: shows how many messages belong to the given category.
* trend: indicates how the occurrence of the messages changes in time.
* category name: it is the name of the category and is derived from the message 
  text.
* datasets: the name of the datasets where the categories are present.
* maximum anomaly score: the highest anomaly score in the category.

To view a log message under a particular category, click  
the arrow at the end of the row. To further examine a message, it 
can be viewed in the corresponding log event on the *Stream* page or displayed in its context.
