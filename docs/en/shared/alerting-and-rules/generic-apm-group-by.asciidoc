Set one or more *group alerts by* fields for custom threshold rules to perform a composite aggregation against the selected fields.
When any of these groups match the selected rule conditions, an alert is triggered _per group_.

When you select multiple groupings, the group name is separated by commas.

When you select *Alert me if a group stops reporting data*, the rule is triggered if a group that previously
reported metrics does not report them again over the expected time period.

.Example: Group by one field
****
If you group alerts by the `service.name` field and there are two services (`Service A` and `Service B`),
when `Service A` matches the conditions but `Service B` doesn't, one alert is triggered for `Service A`.
If both groups match the conditions, alerts are triggered for both groups.
****

.Example: Group by multiple fields
****
If you group alerts by both the `service.name` and `service.environment` fields,
and there are two services (`Service A` and `Service B`) and two environments (`Production` and `Staging`),
the composite aggregation forms multiple groups.

If the `Service A, Production` group matches the rule conditions, but the `Service B, Staging` group doesn't,
one alert is triggered for `Service A, Production`.
