After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency.
You can choose to create a summary of alerts on each check interval or on a custom interval.
Alternatively, you can set the action frequency such that you choose how often the action runs (for example, at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a custom action interval).

You can also further refine the conditions under which actions run by specifying that actions only run they match a KQL query or when an alert occurs within a specific time frame:

* *If alert matches query*: Enter a KQL query that defines field-value pairs or query conditions that must be met for notifications to send. The query only searches alert documents in the indices specified for the rule.
* *If alert is generated during timeframe*: Set timeframe details. Notifications are only sent if alerts are generated within the timeframe you define.
