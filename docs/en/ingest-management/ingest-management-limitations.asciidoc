{ingest-manager} is currently only available to users with the
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[superuser role]. This role is necessary to create
indices, install integration assets, and update {agent} configurations. In order
to use {fleet}, the {agent}s must have a direct network connection to {kib} and
{es}. It is also possible to run the {agent}s in standalone mode in cases where
a network connection is not available or not needed.

This feature has several additional limitations at the current time:

*   Support for only 9 integrations (more coming soon)
*   Support for only {filebeat} and {metricbeat}
*   We recommend you enroll no more than 100 Agents
*   No output to {ls}, Kafka, or other remote clusters
*   No proxy support in {agent}
*   {kib} must have internet access to download integration packages
*   No support for advanced {beats} settings like multiline, processors, and so
on
*   No custom index templates or pipelines
*   No support for Kubernetes or Docker autodiscovery

Experimental releases are not officially supported, but we encourage you to
report issues in our {im-forum}[discuss forum].
