// tag::agent-install-intro[]
{agent} is a single, unified agent that you deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.

You have a few options for installing and managing an {agent}:

* **Install a {fleet}-managed {agent} (recommended)**
+
With this approach, you install {agent} on each host you want to monitor and
use {fleet} in {kib} to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central
location.
+
We recommend using {fleet} management because it makes the management and
upgrade of your agents considerably easier. 
+
Refer to <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.

* **Install {agent} in standalone mode (advanced users)**
+
With this approach, you install {agent} on each host you want to monitor and
manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are
responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved
for advanced users only.
+
Refer to <<install-standalone-elastic-agent>>.

*  **Install {agent} in a containerized environment**
+
You can run {agent} inside of a container -- either with {fleet-server} or
standalone. Docker images for all versions of {agent} are available from the
Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on
Kubernetes.
