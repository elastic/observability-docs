The Feature Flags section of the elastic-agent.yml config file contains settings in {agent} that are disabled by default. These may include experimental features, changes to behaviors within {agent} or its components, or settings that could cause a breaking change. For example a setting that changes information included in events might be inconsistent with the naming pattern expected in your configured {agent} output.

To enable any of the settings listed on this page, change the associated `enabled` flag from `false` to `true`.

== Feature flag configuration settings

You can specify the following settings in the Feature Flag section of the
`elastic-agent.yml` config file.

Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)::
When enabled, information provided about the current host through the <<host-provider,host.name>> key, in events produced by {agent}, is in FQDN format (`somehost.example.com` rather than `somehost`). This helps you to distinguish between hosts on different domains that have similar names. With `fqdn` enabled, the fully qualified hostname allows each host to be more easily identified when viewed in {kib}.
+
For FQDN reporting to work as expected, the hostname of the current host must either:
+
--
* Have a CNAME entry defined in DNS.
* Have one of its corresponding IP addresses respond successfully to a reverse DNS lookup.
--
+
If neither pre-requisite is satisfied, `host.name` continues to report the hostname of the current host as if the FQDN feature flag were not enabled.
+
To enable fully qualified domain names set `enabled: true` for the `fqdn` setting:
