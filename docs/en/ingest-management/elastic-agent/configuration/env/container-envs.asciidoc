Use environment variables to configure {agent} when running in a containerized environment.
Variables on this page are grouped by action type:

* <<env-common-vars,Common variables>>
* <<env-prepare-kibana-for-fleet,Configure {kib}:>> prepare the {fleet} plugin in {kib}
* <<env-bootstrap-fleet-server,Configure {fleet-server}:>> bootstrap {fleet-server} on an {agent}
* <<env-enroll-agent,Configure {agent} and {fleet}:>> enroll an {agent}

[[env-common-vars]]
== Common variables

// forces a unique ID so that settings can be included multiple times on the same page
:type: common

To limit the number of environment variables that need to be set,
the following common variables are available.
These variables can be used across all {agent} actions,
but have a lower precedence than action-specific environment variables.

These common variables are useful, for example, when using the same {es} and {kib} credentials
to prepare the {fleet} plugin in {kib}, configure {fleet-server}, and enroll an {agent}.
