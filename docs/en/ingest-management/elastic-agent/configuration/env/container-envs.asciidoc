In general, there are three types of actions you'll want to take:


* Configure {kib}: Prepare the {fleet} plugin in {kib}
* Configure {fleet-server}: Bootstrap {fleet-server} on an {agent}
* Configure {agent} and {fleet}: Enroll an {agent}




In certain use cases, blah blah blah convenience:

[[env-convenience-vars]]
== Convenience variables

To limit the number of environment variables that need to be set for all actions,
{agent} offers the following convenience variables.
These can be used across all action types
The following environment variables are provided as a convenience to prevent a large number of environment variable to
be used when the same credentials will be used across all the possible actions above.

  ELASTICSEARCH_HOST - elasticsearch host [http://elasticsearch:9200]
  ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME - elasticsearch username [elastic]
  ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD - elasticsearch password [changeme]
  ELASTICSEARCH_CA - path to certificate authority to use with communicate with elasticsearch
  KIBANA_HOST - kibana host [http://kibana:5601]
  KIBANA_USERNAME - kibana username [$ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME]
  KIBANA_PASSWORD - kibana password [$ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD]
