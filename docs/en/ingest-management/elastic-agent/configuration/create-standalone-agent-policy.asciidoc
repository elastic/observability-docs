= Create a standalone {agent} policy

include::{fleet-repo-dir}/standalone-note.asciidoc[]

To get started quickly, use {kib} to add integrations to an agent policy, then
download the policy to use as a starting point for your standalone {agent}
policy. This approach saves time, is less error prone, and populates the
policy with a lot of details that are tedious to add manually. Also,
adding integrations in {kib} loads required assets, such as index templates,
and ingest pipelines, before you start your {agent}s.

TIP: If you're a {fleet} user and already have an agent policy you want to
use in standalone mode, go to *{fleet} > Agents* and click *Add agent*. Follow
the steps under *Run standalone* to download the policy file.

You don't need {fleet} to perform the following steps, but on self-managed
clusters, API keys must be enabled in the {es} configuration (set
`xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true`).

. From the main menu in {kib}, click *Add integrations*, and search for the
{agent} integration you want to use. Read the description to make sure the
integration works with {agent}.

. Click the integration to see more details about it, then click
*Add <Integration>*.

. Under *Configure integration*, enter a name and description for the integration.

. Click the down arrow next to enabled streams and make sure the settings are
correct for your host.

. Under *Apply to agent policy*, select an existing policy, or click
*Create agent policy* and create a new one.

. When youâ€™re done, save and continue.
+
A popup window gives you the option to add {agent} to your hosts.

. (Optional) To add more integrations to the agent policy, click *Add {agent}
later* and go back to the *Integrations* page. Repeat the previous steps for each
integration.

. When you're done adding integrations, in the popup window, click
*Add {agent} to your hosts* to open the *Add agent* flyout. 

. Click *Run standalone* and follow the in-product instructions to download
{agent} (if you haven't already).

. Click *Download Policy* to download the policy file.

The dowloaded policy already contains a default {es} address and port for your
setup. You may need to change them if you use a proxy or load balancer. Modify
the policy, as required, making sure that you provide credentials for connecting
to {es}

If you need to add integrations to the policy _after_ deploying the
it, you'll need to run through these steps again and re-deploy the
updated policy to the host where {agent} is running.

For detailed information about starting the agent, including the permissions
needed for the {es} user, refer to <<install-standalone-elastic-agent>>.

[[update-standalone-policies]]
== Upgrade standalone agent policies after upgrading an integration

Because standalone agents are not managed by {fleet}, they are unable to upgrade
to new integration package versions automatically. When you upgrade an
integration in {kib} (or it gets upgraded automatically), you'll need to update
the standalone policy to use new features and capabilities.

You'll also need to update the standalone policy if you want to add new
integrations.

To update your standalone policy, use the same steps you used to create and
download the original policy file:

. Follow the steps under <<create-standalone-agent-policy>> to create and
download a new policy, then compare the new policy file to the old one.

. Either use the new policy and apply your customizations to it, or
update your old policy to include changes, such as field changes, added
by the upgrade.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you update the standalone agent policy in the directory
where {agent} is running, not the directory where you downloaded the
installation package. Refer to <<installation-layout>> for the location of
installed {agent} files.
