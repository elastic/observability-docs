{agent} monitors {beats} by default. To turn off or change monitoring
settings, set options under `agent.monitoring` in the `elastic-agent.yml` file.

This example configures {agent} monitoring:

[source,yaml]
----
agent.monitoring:
  # enabled turns on monitoring of running processes
  enabled: true
  # enables log monitoring
  logs: true
  # enables metrics monitoring
  metrics: true
  # exposes /debug/pprof/ endpoints for Elastic Agent and Beats
  # enable these endpoints if the monitoring endpoint is set to localhost
  pprof.enabled: false
  # specifies output to be used
  use_output: monitoring
  http:
    # exposes a /buffer endpoint that holds a history of recent metrics
    buffer.enabled: false
----

To turn off monitoring, set `agent.monitoring.enabled` to `false`. When set to
`false`, {beats} monitoring is turned off, and all other options in this section
are ignored.

To enable monitoring, set `agent.monitoring.enabled` to `true`. Also set the
`logs` and `metrics` settings to control whether logs, metrics, or both are
collected. If neither setting is specified, monitoring is turned off. Set
`use_output` to specify the output to which monitoring events are sent.

The `agent.monitoring.pprof.enabled` option controls whether the {agent} and {beats} expose the
`/debug/pprof/` endpoints with the monitoring endpoints. It is set to `false`
by default. Data produced by these endpoints can be useful for debugging but present a
security risk. It is recommended that this option remains `false` if the monitoring endpoint
is accessible over a network.

The `agent.monitoring.http.buffer.enabled` option controls whether the {agent} and {beats}
collect metrics into an in-memory buffer and expose these through a `/buffer` endpoint.
It is set to `false` by default. This data can be useful for debugging or if the {agent}
has issues communicating with {es}. Enabling this option may slightly increase process
memory usage.
