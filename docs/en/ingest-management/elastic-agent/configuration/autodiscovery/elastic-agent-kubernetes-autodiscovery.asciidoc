= Kubernetes autodiscovery with {agent}

When you run applications on containers, they become moving targets to the monitoring system. Autodiscover allows you to track them and adapt settings as changes happen. By defining configuration templates, the autodiscover subsystem can monitor services as they start running.

To use autodiscovery, you will need to modify the manifest file of the {agent}. Refer to <<running-on-kubernetes-standalone>> to learn how to retrieve and configure it.

There are two different ways to use autodiscovery:

* <<conditions-based-autodiscover>>

* <<hints-annotations-autodiscovery>>
