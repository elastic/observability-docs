= Configure standalone {agent}s

include::{fleet-repo-dir}/standalone-note.asciidoc[]

TIP: To get started quickly, use {kib} to create and download a standalone
policy file. You'll still need to deploy and manage the file, though. For more
information, refer to <<create-standalone-agent-policy>>.

Standalone {agent}s are manually configured and managed locally on the systems
where they are installed. They are useful when you are not interested in
centrally managing agents in {fleet}, either due to your company's security
requirements, or because you prefer to use another configuration management
system.

To configure standalone {agent}s, specify settings in the `elastic-agent.yml`
policy file deployed with the agent. Prior to installation,
the file is located in the extracted {agent} package. After installation, the
file is copied to the directory described in <<installation-layout>>. To apply
changes after installation, you must modify the installed file.

For installation details, refer to <<install-standalone-elastic-agent>>.

Alternatively, you can put input configurations in YAML files into the
folder `{path.config}/inputs.d` to separate your configuration into
multiple smaller files.
The YAML files in the `inputs.d` folder should contain input configurations only.
Any other configurations are ignored.
The files are reloaded at the same time as the standalone configuration.

TIP: The first line of the configuration must be `inputs`. Then you can list the
inputs you would like to run. Each input in the policy must have a unique value
for the `id` key. If the `id` key is missing its value defaults to the empty 
string `""`.

inputs:
  - id: unique-logfile-id

The following sections describe some settings you might need to configure to
run an {agent} standalone. For a full reference example, refer to the
<<elastic-agent-reference-yaml,elastic-agent.reference.yml>> file.

The settings described here are available for standalone {agent}s. Settings for
{fleet}-managed agents are specified through the UI. You do not set them
explicitly in a policy file.
