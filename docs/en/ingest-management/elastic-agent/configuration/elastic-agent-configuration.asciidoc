= {agent} standalone configuration

For standalone agents, you configure settings in the `elastic-agent.yml` file.
Prior to installation, edit the file located in the extracted {agent} package.
After installation, edit the file located in the directory described in
<<installation-layout>>. 

TIP: To get started quickly, you can use {fleet} to generate a standalone
configuration. For more information, see <<run-elastic-agent-standalone>>.

The articles in this section describe the settings available for standalone
{agent}s. The policy settings for {fleet}-managed agents are specified through
the UI. You do not set them explicitly in a configuration file.

//TODO: Explain the structure of the file, how it's used, etc.
