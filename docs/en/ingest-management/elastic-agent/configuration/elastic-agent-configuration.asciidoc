= {agent} standalone configuration

TIP: To get started quickly, use {kib} to create and download a standalone
policy file. You'll still need to deploy and manage the file, though. For more
information, refer to <<create-standalone-agent-policy>>.

Standalone {agent}s are manually configured and managed locally on the systems
where they are installed. To configure standalone {agent}s, specify settings in
the `elastic-agent.yml` policy file deployed with the agent. Prior to
installation, the file is located in the extracted {agent} package. After
installation, the file is copied to the directory described in
<<installation-layout>>. To apply changes after installation, you must modify
the installed file.

For installation details, refer to <<install-standalone-elastic-agent>>.

The following sections describe some settings you might need to configure to
run an {agent} standalone. For a full reference example, refer to the
<<elastic-agent-reference-yaml,elastic-agent.reference.yml>> file.

The settings described here are available for standalone {agent}s. Settings for
{fleet}-managed agents are specified through the UI. You do not set them
explicitly in a policy file.

//TODO: Explain the structure of the file, how it's used, etc.
