{agent} is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or {elastic-endpoint} required for your configuration.

Choose the operating system and run the provided commands to download and extract
{agent} on your system.

== Step 2: Enroll and start the {agent}

When the {agent} enrolls it will be configured to send the data associated with the policy that you created.
