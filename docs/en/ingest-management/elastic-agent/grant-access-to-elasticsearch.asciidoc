= Grant standalone {agent}s access to {es}

You can use either API keys or user credentials to grant standalone {agent}s
access to {es} resources. The following minimal permissions are required to send
logs, metrics, traces, and synthetics to {es}:

* `monitor` cluster privilege
* `auto_configure` and `create_doc` index privileges on `logs-*-*`, `metrics-*-*`,
`traces-*-*`, and `synthetics-*-*`.

It's recommended that you use API keys to avoid exposing usernames and passwords
in configuration files.

{fleet-guide}/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html[{fleet} enrollment tokens].

== Create API keys for standalone agents

NOTE: API keys are sent as plain-text, so they only provide security when used
in combination with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Our
{ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud} provides secure, encrypted connections
out of the box! For self-managed {es} clusters, refer to
<<output-elasticsearch-pki-certs-authentication-settings>>.

You can set API keys to expire at a certain time, and you can explicitly
invalidate them. Any user with the `manage_api_key` or `manage_own_api_key`
cluster privilege can create API keys.

For security reasons, we recommend using a unique API key per {agent}. You
can create as many API keys per user as necessary.

To create an API key for {agent}:

. In {kib}, navigate to *{stack-manage-app} > API keys* and click
*Create API key*.

. Enter a name for your API key and select *Restrict privileges*. In the role
descriptors box, copy and paste the following JSON. This example creates an
API key with privileges for ingesting logs, metrics, traces, and synthetics:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "standalone_agent": {
    "cluster": [
      "monitor"
    ],
    "indices": [
      {
        "names": [
          "logs-*-*", "metrics-*-*", "traces-*-*", "synthetics-*-*" <1>
        ],
        "privileges": [
          "auto_configure", "create_doc"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
<1> Adjust this list to match the data you want to collect. For example, if
you aren't using APM or synthetics, remove `"traces-*-*"` and `"synthetics-*-*"`
from this list.

. To set an expiration date for the API key, select *Expire after time* and input
the lifetime of the API key in days.

. Click *Create API key*.
+
You'll see a message indicating that the key was created, along with the
encoded key. By default, the API key is Base64 encoded, but that won't work for
{agent}.

// lint ignore beats
. Click the down arrow next to Base64 and select *Beats*.

. Copy the API key. You will need this for the next step, and you will not be
able to view it again.

. To use the API key, specify the `api_key` setting in the `elastic-agent.yml`
file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
[...]
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'https://da4e3a6298c14a6683e6064ebfve9ace.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443'
    api_key: _Nj4oH0aWZVGqM7MGop8:349p_U1ERHyIc4Nm8_AYkw <1>
[...]
----
<1> The format of this key is `<id>.<key>`. Base64 encoded API keys are not
currently supported in this configuration.

[[create-role-standalone-agent]]
== Create a standalone agent role

Although it's recommended that you use an API key instead of a username and
password to access {es}, you can create a role with the required privileges,
assign it to a user, and specify the user's credentials in the
`elastic-agent.yml` file.

. In {kib}, go to *{stack-manage-app} > Roles*.

. Click *Create role* and enter a name for the role.

. In *Cluster privileges*, enter `monitor`.

. In *Index privileges*, enter:

.. `logs-*-*`, `metrics-*-*`, `traces-*-*` and `synthetics-*-*` in the *Indices*
field. 
+
NOTE: Adjust this list to match the data you want to collect. For example, if
you aren't using APM or synthetics, remove `traces-*-*` and `synthetics-*-*`
from this list.

.. `auto_configure` and `create_doc` in the *Privileges* field.

    password: ES_PASSWORD
[...]
----
<1> For security reasons, specify a user with the minimal privileges described
here. It's recommended that you do not use the `elastic` superuser.
