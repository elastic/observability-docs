= Upgrade standalone {agent}s

include::{fleet-repo-dir}/standalone-note.asciidoc[]

To upgrade a standalone agent running on an edge node:

. Make sure the `elastic-agent` service is running.
. From the directory where {agent} is installed, run the `upgrade` command to
upgrade to a new version. Not sure where the agent is
installed? Refer to <<installation-layout>>.
+
For example, on macOS, to upgrade the agent from version 7.10.0 to 7.10.1, you
would run:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd /Library/Elastic/Agent/
sudo elastic-agent upgrade 7.10.1
----

This command upgrades the binary. If necessary, you must update the
configuration manually.

//QUESTION: Added this ^^ because I think we need to say something about
//the configuration, but I'm not sure what else.

For more command-line options, see the help for the
<<elastic-agent-upgrade-command,`upgrade`>> command.
