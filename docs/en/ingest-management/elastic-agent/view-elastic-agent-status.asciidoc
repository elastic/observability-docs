{fleet} reports these statuses:

|=== 

| *Healthy* | The {agent} is online and running as expected. There are no agent
policy updates or automatic agent binary updates pending, but there might be
manual agent binary updates available.

| *Unhealthy* | The {agent} is online, but requires attention because it's
reporting either agent or integration-level errors.

| *Updating* | The {agent} is online and updating the agent policy, updating the
binary, or enrolling or unenrolling from {fleet}.

| *Offline* | The {agent} has not checked in during the expected time period.

| *Inactive* | The {agent} is inactive.

|===

//QUESTION: What elase can we say about the offline status? That the agent
//might be stopped or no longer able to connect to Fleet? What else?
//QUESTION: What does inactive mean? It shows up in the dropdown.

[[view-agent-logs]]
== View agent logs

When {fleet} reports a status like `offline` or `unhealthy`, you might want to
view the agent logs to diagnose potential causes:

. In the *Agents* list, click the host name (or select *View agent* under
Actions) to view agent details.

. Click *Logs* to see the logs for the selected agent.

To filter the log lines, use the *Dataset* and *Log level* dropdowns. Change the
date range to see log entries from an earlier period. Notice that you can  use
the search bar to create structured queries using
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].

To tail the agent log files in real time, click *Open in Logs*. Refer to
{observability-guide}/tail-logs.html[Tail log files] for more details.

//QUESTION: Can users set alerts on these statuses yet? If so, we should mention
//that here.
