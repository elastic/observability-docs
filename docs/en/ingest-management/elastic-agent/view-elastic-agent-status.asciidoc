= View status of {agent}s

To view the status of your {fleet}-managed agents, go to
*Management > Fleet > Agents*.

{fleet} reports these statuses:

|=== 

| *Healthy* | The {agent} is online and running as expected. There are no agent
policy updates or automatic agent binary updates pending, but there might be
manual agent binary updates available.

| *Unhealthy* | The {agent} is online, but requires attention because it's
reporting either agent or integration-level errors.

| *Updating* | The {agent} is online and updating the agent policy, updating the
binary, or enrolling or unenrolling from {fleet}.

| *Offline* | The {agent} has not checked in during the expected time period.

| *Inactive* | The {agent} is inactive.

|===

//QUESTION: What else can we say about the offline status? That the agent
//might be stopped or no longer able to connect to Fleet? What else?

//QUESTION: What does inactive mean? It shows up in the dropdown.

//QUESTION: Can users set alerts on these statuses yet? If so, we should mention
//that here.
