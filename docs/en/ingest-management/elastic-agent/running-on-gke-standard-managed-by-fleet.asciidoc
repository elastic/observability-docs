= Run {agent} on GKE standard managed by {fleet}

Please follow the steps to run the {agent} on <<running-on-kubernetes-managed-by-fleet>> page.

== Important notes:

On managed Kubernetes solutions like GKE, {agent} has no access to several data sources. Find below the list of the non-available data:

1. Metrics from https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components[Kubernetes control plane] components are not available. Consequently, metrics are not available for `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager`
components. In this regard, the respective **dashboards** will not be populated with data.
2. **Audit logs** are available only on Kubernetes master nodes as well, hence cannot be collected by {agent}.

Also note that the documentation page only applies to Standard GKE and not Autopilot. **Autopilot support** is a work in progress at the time of writing these docs.
