Kubernetes control plane nodes can use https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/[taints] to limit the workloads that can run on them. The manifest for standalone {agent} defines tolerations to run on these. Agents running on control plane nodes collect metrics from the control plane components (scheduler, controller manager) of Kubernetes. To disable {agent} from running on control plane nodes, remove the following part of the DaemonSet spec:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------
spec:
  # Tolerations are needed to run Elastic Agent on Kubernetes control-plane nodes.
  # Agents running on control-plane nodes collect metrics from the control plane components (scheduler, controller manager) of Kubernetes
  tolerations:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
      effect: NoSchedule
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
      effect: NoSchedule
------------------------------------------------

Both these two tolerations do the same, but `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` is https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-role-kubernetes-io-master-taint[deprecated as of Kubernetes version v1.25].
