= Install standalone {agent}s (advanced users)

To run an {agent} in standalone mode, install the agent on each host you want to
monitor and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s
installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This
approach is recommended for advanced users only.

We recommend using <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent,{fleet}-managed {agent}s>>,
when possible, because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents
considerably easier. 

IMPORTANT: Standalone agents are unable to upgrade to new integration package
versions automatically. When you upgrade the integration in {kib}, you'll
need to update the standalone policy manually.

To install and run {agent} standalone:

. On your host, download and extract the installation package.
+
--
// tag::install-elastic-agent[]

include::{tab-widgets}/download-widget.asciidoc[]

// end::install-elastic-agent[]
--
+
Refer to the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[download page] for other
installation options.

. Modify settings in the `elastic-agent.yml` as required.
+
To get started quickly and avoid errors, use {kib} to create and download a
standalone configuration file rather than trying to build it by hand. For more
information, refer to <<create-standalone-agent-policy>>.
+
For additional configuration options, refer to <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.

. In the `elastic-agent.yml` policy file, under `outputs`, specify an API key
or user credentials for the {agent} to access {es}. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
[...]
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'https://da4e3a6298c14a6683e6064ebfve9ace.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443'
    api_key: _Nj4oH0aWZVGqM7MGop8:349p_U1ERHyIc4Nm8_AYkw <1>
[...]
----
+
For more information required privileges and creating API keys, see
<<grant-access-to-elasticsearch>>.

. Make sure the assets you need, such as dashboards and ingest pipelines, are
set up in {kib} and {es}. If you used {kib} to generate the standalone
configuration, the assets are set up automatically. Otherwise, you need to
install them. For more information, refer to <<view-integration-assets>> and
<<install-integration-assets>>.

. From the agent directory, run the following commands to install {agent}
and start it as a service.
+
NOTE: On macOS, Linux (tar package), and Windows, run the `install` command to
install {agent} as a managed service and start the service. The DEB and RPM
packages include a service unit for Linux systems with
systemd, so just enable then start the service.

//TODO: Update the privileges shown above.

Refer to <<installation-layout>> for the location of installed {agent} files.

Because {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will restart
automatically if the system is rebooted.

If you run into problems, refer to <<fleet-troubleshooting>>.

//TODO: Fix link to troubleshooting when we have a topic about troubleshooting for
//stand-alone agents.
