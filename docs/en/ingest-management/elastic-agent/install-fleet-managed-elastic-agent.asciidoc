= Install {fleet}-managed {agent}s

****
{fleet} is a web-based UI in {kib} for
<<manage-agents-in-fleet,centrally managing {agent}s>>. To use {fleet}, you
install {agent} on each host you want to monitor or protect, then enroll the
agent in a policy defined in {kib}. The policy includes integrations that
specify how to collect observability data from specific services and protect
endpoints. The {agent} connects to a trusted <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>>
instance to retrieve the policy and report agent events.
****

These steps assume you're running a fresh installation. If {agent} is already
running on your system, and you want to upgrade to a new version, see
<<upgrade-elastic-agent>>.

If you're a new user, read the
{observability-guide}/fleet-quick-start.html[Quick start] instead of following
the steps described here.

[[elastic-agent-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

* {fleet} is currently only available to users with the
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[superuser role].

* A {fleet-server} must be running in a location accessible to the {agent}. See
<<fleet-server>>.

* To use {fleet}, {agent}s must have a direct network connection to
{fleet-server} and {es}.

* An internet connection is required for {kib} to download integration packages
from the Elastic Package Registry. Make sure the {kib} server can connect to
`https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`.

* You must have an enrollment token generated by {fleet}. Don't have a {fleet}
enrollment key? Read <<fleet-enrollment-tokens>> to learn how to get one from
{fleet}.

* You must have the host and IP where {fleet-server} is running. Not sure where
it's running? Look at the <<fleet-settings,{fleet} settings>> in {kib}.

* If you're running {agent} 7.9 or earlier, stop the agent and manually remove
it from your host.

== Installation steps

To install an {agent} and enroll it in {fleet}:

// tag::agent-enroll[]

. On the machine where you'll run {agent}, download and extract the
installation package.
+
--
// tag::install-elastic-agent[]

include::{tab-widgets}/download-widget.asciidoc[]

// end::install-elastic-agent[]
--
+
See the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[download page] for other
installation options.

. On the **Agents** tab in {fleet}, click **Add agent**.

. Under **Enroll in {fleet}**, follow the in-product installation steps (skip
the download step if you've already done it).

See the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[download page] for other
installation options.

*Notes:*

* Use the default agent policy to get started quickly. This policy includes a
system integration for collecting logs and metrics from the host system. You
can change the policy later.

* On macOS, Linux (tar package), and Windows, run the `install` command to
install {agent} as a managed service, enroll it in {fleet}, and start the
service. The DEB and RPM packages include a service unit for Linux systems with
systemd, so use the `enroll` command instead of `install`.

TIP: If you see an "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" error, you
might be trying to enroll in a {fleet-server} that uses self-signed certs. To
fix this problem in a non-production environment, pass the `--insecure` flag.
For more information, refer to the
{fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html#agent-enrollment-certs[troubleshooting guide].
+
Refer to {fleet-guide}/installation-layout.html[Installation layout] for the
location of installed {agent} files.

Because {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will restart
automatically if the system is rebooted.

To confirm that {agent} is installed and running, go to the **Agents** tab in
{fleet}. Notice that the Default policy is assigned to the agent.

TIP: If the status hangs at Enrolling, make sure the `elastic-agent` process
is running.

If you run into problems:

* Check the {agent} logs. If you use the default policy, agent logs and metrics
are collected automatically unless you change the default settings. For more
information, refer to {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-logging.html[View {agent} logs in {fleet}].

* Refer to the {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[troubleshooting guide].

For information about managing {agent} in {fleet},
refer to {fleet-guide}/manage-agents-in-fleet.html[Centrally manage {agent}s in {fleet}].
