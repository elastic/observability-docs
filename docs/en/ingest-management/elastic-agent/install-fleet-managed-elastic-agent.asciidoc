= Install {fleet}-managed {agent}s

****
{fleet} is a web-based UI in {kib} for
<<manage-agents-in-fleet,centrally managing {agent}s>>. To use {fleet}, you
install {agent}, then enroll the agent in a policy defined in {kib}. The policy
includes integrations that specify how to collect observability data from
specific services and protect endpoints. The {agent} connects to a trusted
<<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> instance to retrieve the policy and report agent
events.

== Where to start

To get up and running quickly, read one of our end-to-end guides:

* New to Elastic? Read our solution
{estc-welcome}/getting-started-guides.html[Getting started guides].
* Want to add data to an existing cluster or deployment? Read our
<<fleet-elastic-agent-quick-start>>.

Looking for upgrade info? Refer to <<upgrade-elastic-agent>>.

[[elastic-agent-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

You will always need:

* *A {kib} user with `All` privileges on {fleet} and {integrations}.* Since many
Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the {kib} privileges in
all spaces.

* *<<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> running in a location accessible to {agent}.*
{agent} must have a direct network connection to
{fleet-server} and {es}. If you're using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud},
{fleet-server} is already available as part of the {integrations-server}. For
self-managed deployments, refer to <<add-a-fleet-server>>.

* *Internet connection for {kib} to download integration packages from the {package-registry}.*
Make sure the {kib} server can connect to
`https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`. If your environment has network traffic
restrictions, there are ways to work around this requirement. See
{fleet-guide}/air-gapped.html[Air-gapped environments] for more information.

If you are using a {fleet-server} that uses your organization's certificate,
you will also need:

* *A Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)
to encrypt traffic.* If your organization already uses the {stack}, you may already have a
CA certificate. If you do not have a CA certificate, you can read more
about generating one in <<secure-connections>>.

If you're running {agent} 7.9 or earlier, stop the agent and manually remove
it from your host.

== Installation steps

NOTE: You can install only a single {agent} per host.

{agent} can monitor the host where it's deployed, and it can collect and forward
data from remote services and hardware where direct deployment is not possible.

To install an {agent} and enroll it in {fleet}:

// tag::agent-enroll[]

// lint disable fleet
. In {kib}, go to **{fleet} > Agents**, and click **Add agent**.

. In the *Add agent* flyout, select an existing agent policy or create a new
one. If you create a new policy, {fleet} generates a new
{fleet-guide}/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html[{fleet} enrollment token].

. Make sure **Enroll in Fleet** is selected.

. Download, install, and enroll the {agent} on your host by selecting
your host operating system and following the **Install {agent} on your host**
step.
.. If you are enrolling the agent in a {fleet-server} that uses your
organization's certificate you _must_ add the `--certificate-authorities`
option to the command provided in the in-product instructions.
If you do not include the certificate, you will see the following error:
"x509: certificate signed by unknown authority".

--
// lint enable fleet

After about a minute, the agent will enroll in {fleet}, download the
configuration specified in the agent policy, and start collecting data.

**Notes:**

* If you encounter an "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" error, you
might be trying to enroll in a {fleet-server} that uses self-signed certs. To
fix this problem in a non-production environment, pass the `--insecure` flag.
For more information, refer to the
{fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html#agent-enrollment-certs[troubleshooting guide].

* Optionally, you can use the `--tag` flag to specify a comma-separated list of
tags to apply to the enrolled {agent}. For more information, refer to
{fleet-guide}/filter-agent-list-by-tags.html[Filter list of Agents by tags].

* Refer to {fleet-guide}/installation-layout.html[Installation layout] for the
location of installed {agent} files.

* Because {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will restart
automatically if the system is rebooted.


To confirm that {agent} is installed and running, go to the **Agents** tab in
{fleet}.

TIP: If the status hangs at Enrolling, make sure the `elastic-agent` process
is running.

If you run into problems:

* Check the {agent} logs. If you use the default policy, agent logs and metrics
are collected automatically unless you change the default settings. For more
information, refer to {fleet-guide}/monitor-elastic-agent.html[Monitor {agent} in {fleet}].

* Refer to the {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[troubleshooting guide].
