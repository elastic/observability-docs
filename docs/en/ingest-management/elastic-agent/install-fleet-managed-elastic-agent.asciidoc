= Install {fleet}-managed {agent}s

****
{fleet} is a web-based UI in {kib} for
<<manage-agents-in-fleet,centrally managing {agent}s>>. To use {fleet}, you
install {agent} on each host you want to monitor or protect, then enroll the
agent in a policy defined in {kib}. The policy includes integrations that
specify how to collect observability data from specific services and protect
endpoints. The {agent} connects to a trusted <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>>
instance to retrieve the policy and report agent events.
****

These steps assume you're running a fresh installation. If {agent} is already
running on your system, and you want to upgrade to a new version, see
<<upgrade-elastic-agent>>.

If you're a new user, instead of following the steps described here, read our
quick start guides:

* {observability-guide}/ingest-logs-metrics-uptime.html[Ingest logs, metrics, and uptime data with {agent}]

* {observability-guide}/ingest-traces.html[Ingest application traces with {agent}]

== Prerequisites

* {kib} user with `All` privileges on {fleet} and {integrations}. Since many
Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the {kib} privileges in
all spaces.

* <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> running in a location accessible to
{agent}. {agent} must have a direct network connection to
{fleet-server} and {es}. If you're using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud},
{fleet-server} is already available as part of the {integrations-server}.

* Internet connection for {kib} to download integration packages
from the {package-registry}. Make sure the {kib} server can connect to
`https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`. If your environment has network traffic
restrictions, there are ways to work around this requirement. See
{fleet-guide}/air-gapped.html[Air-gapped environments] for more information.

* If you're running {agent} 7.9 or earlier, stop the agent and manually remove
it from your host.

[[elastic-agent-installation-steps]]
== Installation steps

To install an {agent} and enroll it in {fleet}:

// tag::agent-enroll[]

// lint disable fleet
. In {kib}, go to **{fleet} > Agents**, and click **Add agent**.

. In the *Add agent* flyout, select an existing agent policy or create a new
one. If you create a new policy, {fleet} generates a new
{fleet-guide}/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html[{fleet} enrollment token].

. Make sure **Enroll in Fleet** is selected.

. Download, install, and enroll the {agent} on your host by selecting
your host operating system and following the **Install {agent} on your host**
step.

--
// lint enable fleet

After about a minute, the agent will enroll in {fleet}, download the
configuration specified in the agent policy, and start collecting data. 

**Notes:**

* If you see an "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" error, you
might be trying to enroll in a {fleet-server} that uses self-signed certs. To
fix this problem in a non-production environment, pass the `--insecure` flag.
For more information, refer to the
{fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html#agent-enrollment-certs[troubleshooting guide].

* Refer to {fleet-guide}/installation-layout.html[Installation layout] for the
location of installed {agent} files.

* Because {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will restart
automatically if the system is rebooted.


To confirm that {agent} is installed and running, go to the **Agents** tab in
{fleet}.

TIP: If the status hangs at Enrolling, make sure the `elastic-agent` process
is running.

If you run into problems:

* Check the {agent} logs. If you use the default policy, agent logs and metrics
are collected automatically unless you change the default settings. For more
information, refer to {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-logging.html[View {agent} logs in {fleet}].

* Refer to the {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[troubleshooting guide].

For information about managing {agent} in {fleet},
refer to {fleet-guide}/manage-agents-in-fleet.html[Centrally manage {agent}s in {fleet}].
