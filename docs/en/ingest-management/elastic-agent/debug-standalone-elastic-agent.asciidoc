[[debug-standalone-agents]]
= Debug standalone {agent}s

When you run standalone {agent}s, you are responsible for monitoring the status
of your deployed {agent}s. You cannot view the status or logs in {fleet}.

Use the following tips to help identify potential issues.

Also refer to <<fleet-troubleshooting>> for guidance on specific problems.

NOTE: You might need to log in as a root user (or Administrator on Windows) to
run these commands.

== Check the status of the running {agent}

To check the status of the running {agent} daemon and other processes managed by
{agent}, run the `status` command. For example:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent status
----

Returns something like: 

[source,yaml]
----
State: HEALTHY
Message: Running
Fleet State: STOPPED
Fleet Message: (no message)
Components:
  * log           (HEALTHY)
                  Healthy: communicating with pid '25423'
  * filestream    (HEALTHY)
                  Healthy: communicating with pid '25424'
----

By default, this command returns the status in human-readable format. Use the
`--output` flag to change it to `json` or `yaml`.

For more information about this command, refer to
<<elastic-agent-status-command>>.

[[inspect-standalone-agent-logs]]
== Inspect {agent} and related logs

If the {agent} status is unhealthy, or behaving unexpectedly, inspect the logs
of the running {agent}.

The log location varies by platform. {agent} logs are in the folders described
in <<installation-layout>>. {beats} and {fleet-server} logs are in folders named
for the output (for example, `default`).

Start by investigating any errors you see in the {agent} and related logs. Also
look for repeated lines that might indicate problems like connection issues. If
the {agent} and related logs look clean, check the host operating system logs
for out of memory (OOM) errors related to the {agent} or any of its processes.

[[increase-log-level]]
== Increase the log level of the running {agent}

The log level of the running agent is set to `info` by default. At this level,
{agent} will log informational messages, including the number of events that are
published. It also logs any warnings, errors, or critical errors.

To increase the log level, set it to `debug` in the `elastic-agent.yml` file.

The `debug` setting configures {agent} to log debug messages, including a
detailed printout of all flushed events, plus all the information collected at
other log levels.

Set other options if you want write logs to a file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
agent.logging.level: debug
agent.logging.to_files: true
agent.logging.files:
  path: /var/log/elastic-agent
  name: elastic-agent
  keepfiles: 7
  permissions: 0600
----

For other log settings, refer to <<elastic-agent-standalone-logging-config>>.

[[expose-debug-endpoint]]
// lint ignore pprof
== Expose /debug/pprof/ endpoints with the monitoring endpoint

Profiling data produced by the `/debug/pprof/` endpoints can be useful for
debugging, but presents a security risk. Do not expose these endpoints if the
monitoring endpoint is accessible over a network. (By default, the monitoring
endpoint is bound to a local Unix socket or Windows npipe and not accessible
over a network.)

To expose the `/debug/pprof/` endpoints, set `agent.monitoring.pprof: true` in
the `elastic-agent.yml` file. For more information about monitoring settings,
refer to <<elastic-agent-monitoring-configuration>>.

After exposing the endpoints, you can access the HTTP handler bound to a socket
for {beats} or the {agent}. For example:

[source,shell]
----
sudo curl --unix-socket /Library/Elastic/Agent/data/tmp/default/filebeat/filebeat.sock http://socket/ | json_pp
----

Returns something like:

[source,json]
----
{
   "beat" : "filebeat",
   "binary_arch" : "amd64",
   "build_commit" : "93708bd74e909e57ed5d9bea3cf2065f4cc43af3",

}

Likewise, the following request:

[source,shell]
----
sudo curl --unix-socket /Library/Elastic/Agent/data/tmp/elastic-agent.sock http://socket/stats | json_pp
----

Returns something like:

[source,shell]

[[inspect-configuration]]
== Inspect the {agent} configuration

To inspect the running {agent} configuration refer to <<elastic-agent-inspect-command>>.

To analyze the current state of the agent, inspect log files, and see the running configuration
of {agent} and the sub-processes it starts, run the `diagnostics` command. For example:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent diagnostics
----

For more information about this command, refer to
<<elastic-agent-diagnostics-command>>.
