[[integrations]]
= Manage integrations

****
Integrations are available for a wide array of popular services and platforms. To
see the full list of available integrations, go to *Management > Integrations*
in {kib}, or visit {integrations-docs}[Elastic Integrations].

Elastic integrations provide a simple, unified way to collect data from popular
apps and services, and protect systems from security threats.

Each integration comes pre-packaged with assets that support all of your
Observability needs:

* Data ingestion, storage, and transformation rules
* Configuration options
* Pre-built, custom dashboards and visualizations
* Documentation
****

The following table shows the main actions you can perform in the *Integrations*
app in {kib}. You can perform some of these actions from other places in {kib},
too.

[[add-integration-under-integrations]]
== Add an integration to a policy

Policies consist of one or more integrations. To add a new integration to a
policy:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations*. Search for and select an
integration.

. Click *Add <Integration>*.

. Name the integration, and add any required configuration variables.

. Choose the policy you want to add the integration to. You can choose an
existing policy or create a new one.

. Click *Save integration* to save the integration policy as a part of the
larger {agent} {policy}. {fleet} will distribute this new policy to all {agent}s
that are enrolled with it.

// TODO: Replace with direct link when the docs are successfully building
If you haven't deployed any {agent}s yet or set up agent policies, start with
one of our Quick starts in the
{observability-guide}/index.html[Observability Guide].

//If you haven't deployed any {agent}s yet or set up agent policies, start with
//one of our quick start guides:

//QUESTION: Should we drop "Quick start" from the title?

//TODO: Make these direct links after the Observability Guide is successfully
//building.

[[view-integrations]]
== View integration policies

An integration policy is created when you add an integration to an {agent}
policy.

To view details about all the integration policies for a specific integration:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations > Manage*. Search for and select
the integration you want to view.

. Click the *Policies* tab to see the list of integration policies.

Open the *Actions* menu to see other actions you can perform from this view.


[discrete]
[[edit-or-delete-integration-policy]]
== Edit or delete an integration policy

To edit or delete an integration policy:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations > Manage*. Search
for and select the integration.

. Click the *Policies* tab to see the list of integration policies.

. Scroll to a specific integration policy.
Open the *Actions* menu and select *Edit integration* or *Delete integration*.
+
Editing or deleting an integration is permanent and cannot be undone.
If you make a mistake, you can always re-configure or re-add an integration.

Any saved changes are immediately distributed and applied to all {agent}s
enrolled in the given {policy}.

[discrete]
[[view-integration-assets]]
== View integration assets

Integrations come with a number of assets, such as dashboards, saved searches,
and visualizations for analyzing data.

To view integration assets:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations > Manage*. Search for and select
the integration you want to view.

. Click the *Assets* tab to see a list of assets.

If {agent} is already streaming data to {es}, you can follow the links to
view the assets in {kib}.

[discrete]
[[update-integration]]
== Update an integration

IMPORTANT: An internet connection is required for {kib} to download integration
packages from the Elastic Package Registry. Make sure the {kib} server can
connect to `https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`.

Elastic releases integration updates periodically. To use new features and
capabilities, you need to update the integration to the latest version and
optionally upgrade integration policies to use the new version.

TIP: In larger deployments, you should test integration updates on a sample
{agent} before rolling out a larger upgrade initiative.

To update an integration to the latest version:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations > Manage*. Search for and select
the integration you want to update. Notice there is a warning icon next to the
version number to indicate an update is available.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/update-integration.png[Settings tab under Integrations shows how to update the integration]

. Click the *Settings* tab, then click *Update to latest version*.
+
Because updates can change the behavior of hosts, updates must be explicitly
requested in the *Integrations* app.

. After the update is complete, verify that the installed version and latest
version match.

Integration policies created before the update will use the older package
version and continue to work. To use the latest version, you need to
upgrade the  policy:

. Click the *Policies* tab and find the integration policies you want to
update.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/upgrade-package-policy.png[Policies tab under Integrations shows how to upgrade the package policy]

. Click *Upgrade* to begin the upgrade process.

. Make any required configuration changes and review the changes before clicking
*Save*.

. Repeat this process for each policy with the out-of-date integration.

<<upgrading-integration-too-many-conflicts, troubleshooting docs>> for manual
steps.

[[uninstall-integration]]
== Uninstall an integration

Uninstall an integration to remove all {kib} and {es} assets that were installed
by the integration.

NOTE: Some integrations, like the System integration, are installed by default
and cannot be uninstalled.

. Before uninstalling an integration,
<<edit-or-delete-integration-policy, delete the integration policy>> from any
{agent} policies that use it.
+
Any {agent}s enrolled in the policy will stop using the deleted integration.

. After deleting all integration policies, click the *Settings* tab.

. Click *Uninstall* to remove all {kib} and {es} assets that were installed by
the integration.
