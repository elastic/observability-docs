[[elastic-agent-enroll-command]]
== elastic-agent enroll

Enroll the {agent} in {fleet}.

Use this command to enroll the {agent} in {fleet} without installing the
agent as a service. You will need to do this if you installed
the {agent} from a DEB or RPM package and plan to use systemd commands to
start and manage the service. This command is also useful for testing
{agent} prior to installing it.

If you've already installed {agent}, use this command to modify the settings that {agent} runs with. 

TIP: To enroll an {agent} _and_ install it as a service, use the
<<elastic-agent-install-command,`install` command>> instead. Installing as a service is the most common scenario.

We recommend that you run the `enroll` (or `install`) command as the root user because some
integrations require root privileges to collect sensitive data. This command
overwrites the `elastic-agent.yml` file in the agent directory.

This command includes optional flags to set up <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>>.

IMPORTANT: This command enrolls the {agent} in {fleet}; it does not start the
agent. To start the agent, either <<start-elastic-agent,start the service>>, if
one exists, or use the <<elastic-agent-run-command,`run` command>> to start the
agent from a terminal.

<1> If no `fleet-server-cert*` flags are specified, {agent} auto-generates a
self-signed certificate with the hostname of the machine. Remote {agent}s
enrolling into a {fleet-server} with self-signed certificates must specify
the `insecure` flag.

[discrete]
=== Options

// These descriptions are included for the enroll and install commands
// tag::enroll-install-options[]

`--ca-sha256 <string>`::
Comma-separated list of certificate authority hash pins used for certificate
verification.

`--certificate-authorities <string>`::
Comma-separated list of root certificates used for server verification.

`--enrollment-token <string>`::
Enrollment token to use to enroll {agent} into {fleet}. You can use
the same enrollment token for multiple agents.

`--fleet-server-cert <string>`::
Certificate to use for exposed {fleet-server} HTTPS endpoint.

`--fleet-server-cert-key <string>`::
Private key to use for exposed {fleet-server} HTTPS endpoint.

`--fleet-server-es <string>`::
Start a {fleet-server} process when {agent} is started, and connect to the
specified {es} URL. 

`--fleet-server-es-ca <string>`::
Path to certificate authority to use to communicate with {es}.

`--fleet-server-host <string>`::
{fleet-server} HTTP binding host (overrides the policy).

`--fleet-server-insecure-http`::
Expose {fleet-server} over HTTP. This option is not recommended because it's
insecure. It's useful during development and testing, but should not be used in
production. When using this option, you should bind {fleet-server} to the
local host (this is the default).

`--fleet-server-policy <string>`::
Used when starting a self-managed {fleet-server} to allow a specific policy to be used,
instead of the Default Fleet Server policy.

`--fleet-server-port <uint16>`::
{fleet-server} HTTP binding port (overrides the policy).

`--fleet-server-service-token <string>`::
Service token to use for communication with {es}. 

`--force`::
Force overwrite of current configuration without prompting for confirmation.
This flag is helpful when using automation software or scripted deployments.

`--help`::
Show help for the `enroll` command.

`--insecure`::
Allow insecure connections to {fleet-server}. This setting is required in the
following situations:
+
--
* When connecting to an HTTP server. The API keys are sent in clear text.
* When connecting to an HTTPs server and the certificate chain cannot be
verified. The content is encrypted, but the certificate is not verified.
--
+
We strongly recommend that you use a secure connection.

`--url <string>`::
Fleet Server URL to use to enroll the {agent} into {fleet}.

[[elastic-agent-install-command]]
== elastic-agent install

Install {agent} permanently on the system and manage it by using the system's
service manager. The agent will start automatically after installation is
complete. On Linux (tar package), this command requires a system and service
manager like systemd.

IMPORTANT: If you installed {agent} from a DEB or RPM package, use the
<<elastic-agent-enroll-command,`enroll` command>> instead of `install`. The DEB
and RPM packages include a service unit for Linux systems with systemd.

You must run this command as the root user (or Administrator on Windows)
to write files to the correct locations. This command overwrites the
`elastic-agent.yml` file in the agent directory.

[discrete]
=== Synopsis

To install the {agent} as a service, enroll it in {fleet}, and start the
