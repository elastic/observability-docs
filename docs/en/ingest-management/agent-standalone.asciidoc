[[agent-standalone-mode]]
= Standalone mode (manual configuration)

Use standalone mode if you are an advanced user who does not want to configure
and manage your {agent}s centrally in {fleet}. Instead, you'll configure and
manage your agents locally on the systems where they are installed. 

IMPORTANT: {agent}s running in standalone mode are currently unable to update to
new integration package versions automatically. When you update the package
version in {kib}, you'll need to update the standalone policy manually.

To configure {agent} manually:

. On the **{fleet}** tab, click **Add agent** and complete the steps under
**Standalone mode**.

. Select an agent policy (or accept the default).

. Copy the content of the agent policy and put it into a file named
`elastic-agent.yml` on the system where {agent} is installed.

NOTE: The policy generated by {fleet} already contains the correct {es} address
and port for your setup. If you run everything locally, the address is
`127.0.0.1:9200`. If you use our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud},
the address corresponds to the {es} endpoint URL that is listed under
**Endpoints** as described in {cloud}/ec-working-with-elasticsearch.html[Work
with {es}].

. Change the {es} username and password in the `outputs` section of the
policy file:

    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'HOST:PORT'
