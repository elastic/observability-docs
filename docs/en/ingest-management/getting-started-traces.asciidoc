= Quick start: Get application traces into the {stack}

experimental::[]

This guide describes how to:

* Collect Application Performance Monitoring (APM) data
* Send APM data to the {stack}
* Explore and visualize the data in real-time

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {forum}[discuss forum].

[[fleet-prereqs-traces]]
== Prerequisites

* Please read the <<fleet-limitations,Fleet limitations>>.

* The APM integration is experimental and has a number of known limitations.
Please read the list of {apm-server-ref-v}/apm-integration.html[known limitations].

* You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our
{ess-product}[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud} (recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.
+
Here's what you need for each deployment type:

[[set-up-fleet-traces]]
== Step 1: Set up {fleet}

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get APM data into the {stack}.

The first time you use {fleet}, you might need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{tab-widgets}/add-fleet-server/widget.asciidoc[]

For more information, see <<fleet-server>>.

[[add-agent-to-fleet-traces]]
== Step 2: Add an {agent} to {fleet}

[TIP]
====
Don't confuse {agent} with APM agents–they are different components.
In a later step, you'll instrument your code with APM agents and send the data
to an APM Server instance that {agent} spins up.
====

include::elastic-agent/elastic-agent.asciidoc[tag=agent-install-intro]

If you plan on enabling Real User Monitoring (RUM), you must run {agent} centrally.
If RUM is disabled, you should run {agent} on edge machines.

To send APM data to the {stack}:

. On the **Agents** tab in {fleet}, click **Add agent**.

. Under **Enroll in {fleet}**, follow the in-product installation steps.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-agent.png[]
+
See the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[download page] for other
installation options.

*Notes:*

* Use the default agent policy to get started quickly. This policy includes a
system integration for collecting logs and metrics from the host system. You
can change the policy later.

* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service,  enrolls it
in the selected policy, and starts the service. For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
./elastic-agent install -f --url=https://10.0.2.2:8220 \
--enrollment-token=blJqaUdua0JqYXA0bmNscVVjUkE6ZGh4WWNRSHRRek9aSS1paEs2cHdFQQ==
----

* Because {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will restart
automatically if the system is rebooted. 

* To see where files are installed, see <<installation-layout>>. 

If installation is successful, you’ll see the agent on the *Agents*
tab in *Fleet*. Notice that the Default policy is assigned to the
agent.

TIP: If the status hangs at Enrolling, make sure the `elastic-agent` process
is running.

If you run into problems, see <<fleet-troubleshooting>>.

[[add-apm-integration]]
== Step 3: Add the APM integration

Next, you'll browse a catalog of integrations, then add an APM integration to
the default policy used by your agent. You use policies to manage settings
across a group of agents. An agent policy may contain any number of integrations
for collecting observability data from the various services running on your
host.

. In {kib}, go back to **Management > {fleet}**, and click the **Integrations**
tab. Use the search bar to find the **Elastic APM** integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-apm.png[{fleet} showing APM integration]
. Click the APM integration to see more details about it, then click
**Add Elastic APM**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-apm-overview.png[{fleet} showing APM integration overview]

. On the **Add APM integration** page, select the default policy.
+
In this guide, you add integrations to the default policy created by
{kib}. After you learn the basics, you can create your own policies and assign
them to agents.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-integration-apm.png[{fleet} Add APM integration page]

. Under **Configure integration**, click the down arrow next to Collect application traces.
Under **Host**, define the host and port where APM Server will listen.
Inspect or change other settings.

. To see the updated policy, click the *Policies* tab, then click the
*Default policy* link.
+
The newly added APM integration should appear under **Integrations** in the
default policy, along with the default `system-1` integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-apm.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with apm-1 datasource]
+
All {agent}s that use this policy will collect APM data from your instrumented services.

[[add-apm-integration-agents]]
== Step 4: Install APM agents

APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each APM agent's configuration–
to the index that its data is stored in {es}.
Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for APM agent and APM Server communication.
This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.

TIP: You can edit your APM integration settings if you need to change the APM Server URL
or secret token to match your APM agents.

[[view-apm-integration-data]]
== Step 5: View your data

Back in {kib}, under Observability, select APM.
You should see application performance monitoring data flowing into the {stack}!

NOTE: The built-in `apm_user` role is not compatible with the APM integration
as it only provides read access to `apm-*` indices.
For a list of indices users need access to, see
{apm-server-ref-v}/apm-integration-data-streams.html[APM data streams]

== What's next?

* Now that data is streaming into the {stack}, take your investigation to a
deeper level! Use https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic {observability}]
to unify your logs, metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
https://www.elastic.co/security[{elastic-sec}]. Adding endpoint protection is
just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
{observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Create alerts] and find out about
problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use machine learning to
{observability-guide}/inspect-log-anomalies.html[detect anomalies].

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
other hosts by deploying {agent}s across your infrastructure!
