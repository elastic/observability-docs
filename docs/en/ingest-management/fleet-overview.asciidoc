[[elastic-agent]]
== {agent}

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and
other types of data to each host. A single agent makes it easier and faster
to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. The agent's single, unified
policy makes it easier to add integrations for new data sources.

[[fleet]]
== {fleet}

{fleet} provides a web-based UI in {kib} to add and manage integrations
for popular services and platforms, as well as manage a fleet of {agent}s. Our
integrations provide an easy way to add new sources of data, plus they ship
with out-of-the-box assets like dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines to
extract structured fields out of logs. This makes it easier to get insights
within seconds.

[[configuring-integrations]]
== {integrations} in {fleet}

{fleet} provides a web-based UI for configuring integrations with your
data sources. This includes popular services and platforms like Nginx or AWS,
as well as many generic input types like log files.

The {agent} policy allows you to use any number of integrations for
data sources. You can apply the {agent} policy to multiple agents,
making it even easier to manage configuration at scale.

When you add an integration, you select the agent policy to use then
configure inputs for logs and metrics, such as the path to your Nginx access
logs. When you're done, you save the integration to update the {agent}
policy. The next time enrolled agents check in, they receive the update.
Having the policies automatically deployed is more convenient
than doing it yourself by using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or some other tool.

If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may use YAML files and APIs.
{fleet} has an API-first design. Anything you can do in the UI, you
can also do using the API. This makes it easy to automate and integrate with
other systems.

[[agent-self-protection]]
== {agent} self-protection

On MacOS and Windows, {agent} can self-protect against malicious users and
attackers when the {endpoint-sec} integration is added to the agent policy. For
more information, see
{security-guide}/es-overview.html#self-protection[{elastic-endpoint} self-protection].

[[central-management]]
== Central management in {fleet}

You can see the state of all your {agent}s in {fleet}. On the **Agents** page,
you can see which agents are online, which have errors, and the last time
they checked in. You can also see the version of the {agent} binary and
policy.

{fleet} serves as the communication channel back to the {agent}s. Agents check
in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of agents
enrolled into each agent policy, which allows you to scale up to
thousands of hosts. When you make a change to an agent policy, all the
agents receive the update during their next check-in. You no longer have to
distribute policy updates yourself.

[[data-streams-intro]]
=== Data streams make index management easier

The data collected by {agent} is stored in indices that are more granular than
you'd get by default with the Beats shippers or APM Server. This gives you more visibility into the
sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index
permissions. These indices are called <<data-streams,_data streams_>>.
