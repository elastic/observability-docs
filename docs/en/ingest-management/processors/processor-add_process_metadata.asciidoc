The `add_process_metadata` processor enriches events with information from running
processes, identified by their process ID (PID).

[discrete]
== Example

[source,yaml]
----
  - add_process_metadata:
      match_pids: [system.process.ppid]
      target: system.process.parent
----

The fields added to the event look as follows:

[source,json]
----
"process": {
  "name":  "systemd",
  "title": "/usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 22",
  "exe":   "/usr/lib/systemd/systemd",
  "args":  ["/usr/lib/systemd/systemd", "--switched-root", "--system", "--deserialize", "22"],
  "pid":   1,
  "parent": {
    "pid": 0
  },
  "start_time": "2018-08-22T08:44:50.684Z",
  "owner": {
    "name": "root",
    "id": "0"
  }
},
"container": {
  "id": "b5285682fba7449c86452b89a800609440ecc88a7ba5f2d38bedfb85409b30b1"
},
----

Optionally, the process environment can be included, too:
[source,json]
----
  ...
  "env": {
    "HOME":       "/",
    "TERM":       "linux",
    "BOOT_IMAGE": "/boot/vmlinuz-4.11.8-300.fc26.x86_64",
    "LANG":       "en_US.UTF-8",
  }
  ...

== Configuration settings

[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Required | Default | Description

| `match_pids`
| Yes
|
| List of fields to lookup for a PID. The processor searches the list sequentially until the field is found in the current event, and the PID lookup is then applied to the value of this field.

| `target`
| No 
| event root
| Destination prefix where the `process` object will be created.

| `include_fields`
| No
|
| List of fields to add. By default, adds all available fields except `process.env`. 

| `ignore_missing`
| No
| `true`
| Whether to ignore missing fields. If `false`, discards events that don't contain any of the fields specified in `match_pids` and then generates an error. If `true`, missing fields are ignored.

| `overwrite_keys`
| No
| `false`
| Whether to overwrite existing keys. If `false` and a target field already exists, it is not, overwritten, and an error is logged. If `true`, the target field is overwritten.

| `restricted_fields`
| No
| `false`
| Whether to output restricted fields. If `false`, to avoid leaking sensitive data, the `process.env` field is not output. If `true`, the field will be present in the output.

| `host_path`
| No
| root directory (`/`) of host
| Host path where `/proc` is mounted. For different runtime configurations of Kubernetes or Docker, set the `host_path` to overwrite the default.

| `cgroup_prefixes`
| No
| `/kubepods` and `/docker`
| Prefix where the container ID is inside cgroup. For different runtime configurations of Kubernetes or Docker, set `cgroup_prefixes` to overwrite the defaults.

| `cgroup_regex`
| No
|
a| Regular expression with capture group for capturing the container ID from the cgroup path. For example:

. `^\/.+\/.+\/.+\/([0-9a-f]{64}).*` matches the container ID of a cgroup
like `/kubepods/besteffort/pod665fb997-575b-11ea-bfce-080027421ddf/b5285682fba7449c86452b89a800609440ecc88a7ba5f2d38bedfb85409b30b1`
. `^\/.+\/.+\/.+\/docker-([0-9a-f]{64}).scope` matches the container ID of a cgroup
like `/kubepods.slice/kubepods-burstable.slice/kubepods-burstable-pod69349abe_d645_11ea_9c4c_08002709c05c.slice/docker-80d85a3a585f1575028ebe468d83093c301eda20d37d1671ff2a0be50fc0e460.scope`
. `^\/.+\/.+\/.+\/crio-([0-9a-f]{64}).scope` matches the container ID of a cgroup
like `/kubepods.slice/kubepods-burstable.slice/kubepods-burstable-pod69349abe_d645_11ea_9c4c_08002709c05c.slice/crio-80d85a3a585f1575028ebe468d83093c301eda20d37d1671ff2a0be50fc0e460.scope`

If `cgroup_regex` is not set, the container ID is extracted from the cgroup file based on the `cgroup_prefixes` setting. 

| `cgroup_cache_expire_time`
| No
| `30s`
| Time in seconds before cgroup cache elements expire. To disable the cgroup cache, set this to `0`. In some container runtime technologies, like runc, the container's process is also a process in the host kernel and will be affected by PID rollover/reuse. Set the expire time to a value that is smaller than the PIDs wrap around time to avoid the wrong container ID.
