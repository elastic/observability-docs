experimental[]

The `decode_csv_fields` processor decodes fields containing records in
comma-separated format (CSV). It will output the values as an array of strings.

//REVIEWERS: This processor is available for Filebeat and Journalbeat. Should
//it be included in the agent docs? If so, any limitations we need to point out?

|===
| Name | Required | Default | Description

| `fields`
| Yes
|
| A mapping from the source field containing the CSV data to the destination field to which the decoded array will be written.

| `separator`
| No
| comma character (`,`)
| Character to use as a column separator. To use a TAB character, set this value to "\t".

| `ignore_missing`
| No
| `false`
| Whether to ignore events that lack the source field. If `false`, events missing the source field will fail processing.

| `overwrite_keys`
| No
| `false`
| Whether the target field is overwritten if it already exists. If `false`, processing of an event fails if the target field already exists.

| `trim_leading_space`
| No
| `false`
| Whether extra space after the separator is trimmed from values. This works even if the separator is also a space.

| `fail_on_error`
| No
| `true`
| Whether to fail if an error occurs. If `true` and an error occurs, any changes to the event are reverted, and the original event is returned. If `false`, processing continues even if an error occurs.

//REVIEWERS: Some of the descriptions in the original Beats docs did not indicate
//that they were optional, but I'm assuming that anything with a default is optional.
