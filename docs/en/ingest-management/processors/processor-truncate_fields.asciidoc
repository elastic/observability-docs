The `truncate_fields` processor truncates a field to a given size. If the size
of the field is smaller than the limit, the field is left as is.

== Example

This configuration truncates the field named `message` to five characters:

[source,yaml]
----
  - truncate_fields:
      fields:
        - message
      max_characters: 5
      fail_on_error: false
      ignore_missing: true

| Yes
|
| Maximum number of bytes in a field. Mutually exclusive with `max_characters`.

| `max_characters`
| Yes
|
| Maximum number of characters in a field. Mutually exclusive with `max_bytes`.

| `fail_on_error`
| No
| `true`
| If `true` and an error occurs, any changes to the event are reverted, and the original event is returned. If `false`, processing continues even if an error occurs.

| `ignore_missing`
| No
