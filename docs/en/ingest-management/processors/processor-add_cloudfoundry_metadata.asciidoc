= Add Cloud Foundry metadata

++++
<titleabbrev>add_cloudfoundry_metadata</titleabbrev>
++++

The `add_cloudfoundry_metadata` processor annotates each event with relevant
metadata from Cloud Foundry applications.

For events to be annotated with Cloud Foundry metadata, they must have a field
called `cloudfoundry.app.id` that contains a reference to a Cloud Foundry
application, and the configured Cloud Foundry client must be able to retrieve
information for the application.

Each event is annotated with:

* Application Name
* Space ID
* Space Name
* Organization ID
* Organization Name

NOTE: Pivotal Application Service and Tanzu Application Service include this
metadata in all events from the firehose since version 2.8. In these cases the
metadata in the events is used, and `add_cloudfoundry_metadata` processor
doesn't modify these fields.

For efficient annotation, application metadata retrieved by the Cloud Foundry
client is stored in a persistent cache on the filesystem. This is done so the
metadata can persist across restarts of {agent} and its underlying programs. For
control over this cache, use the `cache_duration` and `cache_retry_delay`
settings.

== Example

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - add_cloudfoundry_metadata:
      api_address: https://api.dev.cfdev.sh
      client_id: uaa-filebeat
      client_secret: verysecret
      ssl:
        verification_mode: none
      # To connect to Cloud Foundry over verified TLS you can specify a client and CA certificate.
      #ssl:
      #  certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/cf/ca.pem"]
      #  certificate:              "/etc/pki/cf/cert.pem"
      #  key:                      "/etc/pki/cf/cert.key"
