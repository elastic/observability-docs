= Generate a fingerprint of an event

++++
<titleabbrev>fingerprint</titleabbrev>
++++

The `fingerprint` processor generates a fingerprint of an event based on a
specified subset of its fields.

The value that is hashed is constructed as a concatenation of the field name and
field value separated by `|`. For example `|field1|value1|field2|value2|`.

Nested fields are supported in the following format: `"field1.field2"`, for example: `["log.path.file", "foo"]`

== Example

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------------------------
  - fingerprint:
      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
-----------------------------------------------------

| No
| `false`
| Whether to ignore missing fields.

| `target_field`
| No
| `fingerprint`
| Field in which the generated fingerprint should be stored.

| `method`
| No
| `sha256`
| Algorithm to use for computing the fingerprint. Must be one of: `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`, or `xxhash`.

| `encoding`
