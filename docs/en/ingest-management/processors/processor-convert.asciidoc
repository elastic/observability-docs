= Convert field type

The `convert` processor converts a field in the event to a different type, such
as converting a string to an integer.

The supported types include: `integer`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string`,
`boolean`, and `ip`.

The `ip` type is effectively an alias for `string`, but with an added validation
that the value is an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

== Example

[source,yaml]
----
  - convert:
      fields:
        - {from: "src_ip", to: "source.ip", type: "ip"}
        - {from: "src_port", to: "source.port", type: "integer"}
      ignore_missing: true
      fail_on_error: false

== Configuration settings

[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Required | Default | Description

| `fields`
| Yes
|
| List of fields to convert. The list must contain at least one item. Each item must have a `from` key that specifies the source field. The `to` key is optional and specifies where to assign the converted value. If `to` is omitted, the `from` field is updated in-place. The `type` key specifies the data type to convert the value to. If `type` is omitted, the processor copies or renames the field without any type conversion.

| `ignore_missing`
| No
| `false`
| Whether to ignore missing `from` keys. If `true` and the `from` key is not found in the event, the processor continues to the next field. If `false`, the processor returns an error and does not process the remaining fields.

| `fail_on_error`
| No
| `true`
| Whether to fail when a type conversion error occurs. If `false`, type conversion failures are ignored, and the processor continues to the next field.

| `tag`
| No
|
| Identifier for this processor. Useful for debugging.

| `mode`
| No
| `copy`
| When both `from` and `to` are defined for a field, `mode` controls whether to `copy` or `rename` the field when the type conversion is successful.
