The `urldecode` processor specifies a list of fields to decode from URL encoded format. Under the `fields`
key, each entry contains a `from: source-field` and a `to: target-field` pair, where:

* `from` is the source field name
* `to` is the target field name (defaults to the `from` value)

== Example

[source,yaml]
-------
  - urldecode:
      fields:
        - from: "field1"
          to: "field2"
      ignore_missing: false
      fail_on_error: true
-------

In this example, `field1` is decoded in `field2`.

== Configuration settings

|===
| Name | Required | Default | Description

| `ignore_missing`
| No
| `false`
| If `true`, no error is logged if a key that should be URL-decoded is missing.

| `fail_on_error`
| No
| `true`
| If `true` and an error occurs, the URL-decoding of fields is stopped, and the original event is returned. If `false`, decoding continues even if an error occurs during decoding.
