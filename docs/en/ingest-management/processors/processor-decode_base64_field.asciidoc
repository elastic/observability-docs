= Decode Base64 fields

The `decode_base64_field` processor specifies a field to base64 decode.

To overwrite fields, either rename the target field or use the `drop_fields`
processor to drop the field, and then rename the field.

== Example

In this example, `field1` is decoded in `field2`.

  - decode_base64_field:
      field:
        from: "field1"
        to: "field2"
      ignore_missing: false
      fail_on_error: true

| Name | Required | Default | Description

| `field`
| Yes
|
a| Contains:

* `from: "old-key"`, where `from` is the origin
* `to: "new-key"`, where `to` is the target field name

| `ignore_missing`
| No
| `false`
| Whether to ignore missing keys. If `true`, missing keys that should be base64 decoded are ignored and no error is logged. If `false`, an error is logged and the behavior of `fail_on_error` is applied.

| `fail_on_error`
| No
| `true`
| Whether to fail if an error occurs. If `true` and an error occurs, an error is logged and the event is dropped. If `false`, an error is logged, but the event is not modified.
