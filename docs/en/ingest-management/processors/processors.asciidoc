= Define processors

//REVIEWERS: I think we need to define "processors." Here's my first shot.
//I think we also need to make it clear that these are different from the
//processors defined in ingest pipelines. Should we qualify the name?

Processors are lightweight processing components that you can use to parse,
filter, transform, and enrich data at the source. For example, you can use
processors to:

* reduce the number of exported fields
* enhance events with additional metadata
* perform additional processing and decoding
* sanitize data

Each processor receives an event, applies a defined action to the event, and
returns the event. If you define a list of processors, they are executed in the
order they are defined.

event -> processor 1 -> event1 -> processor 2 -> event2 ...

[[where-valid]]
== Where are processors valid?

The processors described in this section are valid:

* **Under integration settings in the Integrations UI in {kib}**. For example,
when configuring an Nginx integration, you can define processors for a specific
dataset under **Advanced options**. The processor in this example adds geo
metadata to the Nginx access logs collected by {agent}:

NOTE: Some integrations do not currently support processors.

* **Under input configuration settings for standalone {agent}s**. For example:

//REVIEWERS: Does this config look correct? I modified the policy created
//by Fleet, but not sure if I stripped out anything important.

You can define processors that apply to all inputs defined in the configuration,
or specific inputs.

[[limitations]]
== What are some limitations of using processors?

Processors have the following limitations.

* Cannot enrich events with data from {es} or other custom data
sources.
* Cannot process data after it's been converted to the Elastic Common
Schema (ECS) because the conversion is performed by {es} ingest pipelines.
* May break integration ingest pipelines in {es} if the user-defined processing
removes or alters fields expected by ingest pipelines.

//REVIEWERS: Need more input into the last item in this list to make it more
//accurate.

[[processing-options]]
== What other options are available for processing data?

//REVIEWERS: I'd like to consider reusing a portion of the diagram we created
//for the ingest cloud docs. I think the decision tree is more useful than
//a bunch of words, and it sends users off to learn more. WDYT?

The {stack} provides several options for processing data collected by {agent}.
Use the following diagram to help you decide which options work best for your
use case. Follow the links in the diagram to learn more about each option.

//TODO: Replace the placeholder image with a navigable diagram.

[[how-different]]
== How are {agent} processors different from {ls} plugins or ingest pipelines?

Logstash plugins and ingest pipelines both require you to send data to another
system for processing. Processors, on the other hand, allow you to apply
processing logic at the source. This means that you can filter out data you
don't want to send across the connection, and you can spread some of the
processing load across host systems running on edge nodes.
