The `include_fields` processor specifies which fields to export if a certain
condition is fulfilled. The condition is optional. If it's missing, the
specified fields are always exported. The `@timestamp`, `@metadata`, and `type`
fields are always exported, even if they are not defined in the `include_fields`
list.

== Example

[source,yaml]
-------
  - include_fields:
      when:
        condition
      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
-------

See <<conditions>> for a list of supported conditions.

// set this attribute for processors that reference event fields
:works-with-fields:
include::processors.asciidoc[tag=processor-limitations]
// reset the attribute to null
:works-with-fields!:

You can specify multiple `include_fields` processors under the `processors`
section.

NOTE: If you define an empty list of fields under `include_fields`, only
the required fields, `@timestamp` and `type`, are exported.
