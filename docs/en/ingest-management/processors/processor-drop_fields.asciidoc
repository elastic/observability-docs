[[drop_fields-processor]]
= Drop fields from events

The `drop_fields` processor specifies which fields to drop if a certain
condition is fulfilled. The condition is optional. If it's missing, the
specified fields are always dropped. The `@timestamp` and `type` fields cannot
be dropped, even if they show up in the `drop_fields` list.

== Example

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------------------------
  - drop_fields:
      when:
        condition
      fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
      ignore_missing: false
-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you define an empty list of fields under `drop_fields`, no fields
are dropped.
