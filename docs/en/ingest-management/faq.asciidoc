[[enrolled-agent-not-showing-up]]
== Why doesn't my enrolled agent show up in the {fleet} app?

If {agent} was successfully enrolled, but doesn't show up in the *Agents* list,
it might not be started. Make sure the `elastic-agent` process is running on
the host. If it's not running, use the <<elastic-agent-run-command,`run`>>
command to start it.

//TODO: Verify that this is correct. Or would you use the restart command?

[[where-are-the-agent-logs]]
== Where does {agent} store logs after startup?

When started successfully, {metricbeat} logs are stored in
`data/logs/metricbeat` under the folder where {agent} was started. If that log
path does not exist, {agent} was unable to start {metricbeat}, which is a
higher level problem to triage.

[discrete]
[[what-is-my-agent-config]]
== What policy is the {agent} running?

To find the policy file, inspect the `elastic-agent.yml` file in the
folder where you ran {agent}. If you're running the agent in {fleet} mode, this
file contains the following citation:

[source,yaml]
----
Management: mode: "fleet"
----

The `action_store.yml` contains the entire, unencrypted policy:

* To see the {es} location, look at `outputs:hosts`.
* To see the {agent} version, look at the download folder and zip filenames.

This file also shows the version of all packages used by the current
policy.

[[where-is-the-data-agent-is-sending]]
== Why can't I see the data {agent} is sending?

If {elastic-agent} is set up and running, but you don't see data in {kib}:



. Go to **Management > Dev Tools** in {kib}, and in the Console, search your
index for data. For example:
+
[source,console]
----
GET metrics-*/_search
----
+
Or if you prefer, go to the **Discover** app.

. Look at the data that {elastic-agent} has sent and see if the `name.host`
field contains your host machine name.

If you don't see data for your host, it's possible that the data is blocked
in the network, or that a firewall or security problem is preventing the {agent}
from sending the data.

Although it's redundant to install stand-alone {metricbeat}, you might want to
try installing it to see if it's able to send data successfully to {es}. For
more information, see
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html[{metricbeat} quick start].

If {metricbeat} is able to send data to {es}, there is possibly a bug or
problem with {agent}, and you should report it.

[[i-deleted-my-agent]]
== How do I restore an {agent} that I deleted from {fleet}?

It's ok, we've got your back! The data is still in {es}. To add {agent}
to {fleet} again, <<stop-elastic-agent>>, re-enroll it on the host, then
run {agent}.

[discrete]
[[i-rebooted-my-host]]
== How do I restart {agent} after rebooting my host?

//TODO: Verify that this works (it didn't work for me on macOS)

{agent} should restart automatically when you reboot your host. If it doesn't,
you can start it manually by running:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent run
----

If the process is already running, you can restart it by running:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent restart
----

[[does-agent-download-packages]]
== Does {agent} or {kib} download integration packages?

{agent} does not download integration packages. When you add an integration in
{fleet}, {kib} connects to the {package-registry} at `epr.elastic.co`,
downloads the integration package, and stores its assets in {es}. This means
that you no longer have to run a manual setup command to load integrations as
you did previously with {beats} modules.

[discrete]
[[does-agent-download-anything-from-internet]]
== Does {agent} download anything from the Internet?

In most cases, the data collection software required by {agent} is bundled
with the agent. There is one special exception: endpoint security. When an
{agent} policy is set to include the {elastic-endpoint-integration} integration,
{agent} must download software from the Elastic download site.

NOTE: Bundling endpoint security capabilities with {agent} is a known
feature request scoped for a future release. 

[discrete]
[[do-i-need-to-setup-elastic-agent]]
== Do I need to set up the {beats} managed by {agent}?

You might have noticed that {agent} runs {beats} under the hood. But note that
the {beats} managed by {agent} are set up and run differently from standalone
{beats}. 

For example, standalone {beats} use modules and require you to run a setup
command on the host to load assets, such as ingest pipelines and dashboards. In
contrast, {beats} managed by {agent} use integration packages that {kib}
downloads from the {package-registry} at `epr.elastic.co`. This means that
{agent} does not need extra privileges to set up assets because
{fleet} manages the assets.

[discrete]
[[what-is-the-endpoint-package]]
== What is the {elastic-endpoint-integration} integration in {fleet}?

The {elastic-endpoint-integration} integration provides protection on your {agent}
controlled host. The integration monitors your host for security-related events,
allowing for investigation of security data through the {security-app} in {kib}.
The {elastic-endpoint-integration} integration is managed by {agent} in the
same way as other integrations. Try it out! For more information, see the
{security-guide}/index.html[{elastic-sec} documentation].

[discrete]
[[how-are-security-to-agent-communications-secured]]
== How are communications secured between {elastic-sec} and {agent}?

{elastic-sec} connects to the agent over loopback TLS on port 6788.
{elastic-sec} validates that the agent has root (Linux and macOS) or SYSTEM
(Windows) permissions.

//REVIEWERS: Unsure here whether we want to say Elastic Endpoint or Elastic
//Security. ^^


[discrete]
[[how-are-agent-kibana-communications-secured]]
== How are communications secured between {agent} and {kib}?

{agent} connects to {kib} over TLS and authenticates the certificate
presented by {kib}. The agent then provides an API key as an authentication
token, which {kib} validates.

[discrete]
[[which-es-kibana-ports-are-needed]]
== Which {es} and {kib} ports need to be accessible?

The policy generated by {fleet} already contains the correct {es} address
and port for your setup. If you run everything locally, the address is
`127.0.0.1:9200`. If you use our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud},
you can copy the {es} endpoint URL from the overview page of your deployment.
If you're not running in {ecloud}, make sure the {kib} and {es} HTTPS ports
are both accessible; by default these are `5601` and `9200` respectively.
