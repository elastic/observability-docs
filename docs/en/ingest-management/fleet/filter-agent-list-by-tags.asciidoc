[[filter-agent-list-by-tags]]
= Filter list of Agents by tags

When you install or enroll {agent} in {fleet}, you can specify a comma-separated
list of tags to apply to the agent, then use the tags to filter the Agents list
shown in {fleet}.

Tags are useful for capturing information that is specific to the installation
environment, such machine type, location, operating system, environment, and
so on. Tags can be any arbitrary information that will help you filter and
perform operations on {agent}s with the same attributes.

To filter the Agents list by tag, in {kib}, go to **{fleet} > Agents** and click
**Tags**. Select the tags to filter on. The tags are also available in the KQL
field for autocompletion.

If you haven't applied tags to any {agent}s yet, the list will be empty.

[[apply-tags]]
== Apply tags to {agent}s

To apply tags, specify a comma-separated list of tags when you install or enroll
{agent} in {fleet}. If the agent is already enrolled in {fleet}, you must
unenroll the agent, then re-enroll it to apply tags.

The following command applies the `macOS` and `staging` tags during
installation:

[source,shell]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install \
  --url=<Fleet Server host URL> \
  --enrollment-token=<enrollment token> \
  --tag macOS,staging
----

For the full command synopsis, refer to <<elastic-agent-install-command>> and
<<elastic-agent-enroll-command>>.

The following command applies the `docker` and `dev` tags to {agent} running in
a Docker container:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
----
docker run \
  --env FLEET_ENROLL=1 \
  --env FLEET_URL=<Fleet Server host URL> \
  --env FLEET_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN=<enrollment token> \
  --env ELASTIC_AGENT_TAGS=docker,dev
  --rm docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent:{version}
----

For more information about running on containers, refer to the guides under
<<install-elastic-agents-in-containers>>.

[[edit-or-remove-tags]]
== Edit or remove tags

Currently, there is no way to edit or remove existing tags. To change the
tags, you must unenroll {agent}, then re-enroll it using new tags.
