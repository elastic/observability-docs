= Deploy on {ecloud}

To use {fleet} for central management, a <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> must
be running and accessible to your hosts. Provisioning {fleet-server} on {ecloud}
as part of the hosted {ess} is one of <<add-a-fleet-server,several approaches>>
to setting up {fleet-server}.

{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {integrations-server} that includes
{fleet-server}. No extra setup is required unless you want to scale your
deployment.

[[fleet-server-compatibility]]
== Compatibility and prerequisites

{fleet-server} is compatible with the following Elastic products:

* {stack} 7.13 or later.
** For version compatibility: {es} >= {fleet-server} >= {agent} (except for
bugfix releases)
** {kib} should be on the same minor version as {es}.

* {ece} 2.10 or later
+
--
** Requires additional wildcard domains and certificates (which normally only
cover `*.cname`, not `*.*.cname`). This enables us to provide the URL for
{fleet-server} of `https://.fleet.`.
** The deployment template must contain an {integrations-server} node.

For more information about hosting {fleet-server} on {ece}, refer to
{ece-ref}/ece-manage-integrations-server.html[Manage your {integrations-server}].

[[add-fleet-server-cloud-set-up]]
== Setup

To confirm that an {integrations-server} is available in your deployment:

. In {kib}, go to *Management* -> *{fleet}*.
. On the **Agents** tab, look for the **{ecloud} agent policy**. This policy is
managed by {ecloud}, and contains a {fleet-server} integration and an Elastic
APM integration. You cannot modify the policy. Confirm that the agent status is
**Healthy**.

[TIP]
====
Don't see the agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
{integrations-server} instance. This instance is required to use {fleet}.
