[[monitor-elastic-agent]]
= Monitor {agent}s

{fleet} provides built-in capabilities for monitoring your fleet of {agent}s.
In {fleet}, you can:

* <<view-agent-status>>
* <<view-agent-logs>>
* <<collect-agent-diagnostics>>
* <<view-agent-metrics>>

Agent monitoring is turned on by default in the agent policy unless you
turn it off. Want to turn off agent monitoring to stop collecting logs and
metrics? See <<change-agent-monitoring>>.

[[view-agent-status]]
= View agent status

To view the status of your {fleet}-managed agents, in {kib}, go to
**Management -> {fleet} -> Agents**.

[role="screenshot"]

{agent}s can have the following statuses:

|===

| *Healthy* | Healthy {agent}s are enrolled and checked-in. There are no agent policy updates or automatic agent binary updates in progress, but the agent binary may still be out of date. {agent}s continuously check in to the {fleet-server} 
for required updates. 

| *Unhealthy* | Unhealthy {agent}s have not checked in to {fleet-server}. At this point, you may need to address the situation. 

| *Updating* | Updating {agent}s are updating the agent policy, updating the binary, or enrolling or unenrolling from Fleet.

| *Offline* | Offline {agent}s have stayed in an unhealthy status for a period of time. Offline agent's API keys remain valid. You can still see these {agent}s in the {fleet} UI and investigate them for further diagnosis if required.

| *Inactive* | Inactive {agent}s have been offline for longer than the time set in your <<set-inactivity-timeout,inactivity timeout>>. These {agent}s are valid, but have been removed from the main {fleet} UI. 

| *Unenrolled* | Unenrolled {agent}s have been manually unenrolled and their API keys have been removed from the system. You can <<unenroll-elastic-agent,unenroll>> an offline {agent} using {agent} actions if you determine it's offline and no longer valid. 

These agents need to re-enroll in {fleet} to be operational again.

The following diagram shows the flow of {agent} statuses:

To filter the list of agents by status, click the **Status** dropdown and select
one or more statuses.

For advanced filtering, use the search bar to create structured queries
using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language]. For example, enter
`local_metadata.os.family : "darwin"` to see only agents running on macOS.

[discrete]
[[view-agent-logs]]
= View agent logs

When {fleet} reports an agent status like `Offline` or `Unhealthy`, you might
want to view the agent logs to diagnose potential causes. If agent monitoring
is configured to collect logs (the default), you can view agent logs in {fleet}.

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> {fleet} -> Agents**.

. In the **Host** column, click the agent's name.

. On the **Agent details** tab, verify that **Monitor logs** is enabled. If
it's not, refer to <<change-agent-monitoring>>.

. Click the **Logs** tab.

On the **Logs** tab you can filter, search, and explore the agent logs:

* Use the search bar to create structured queries using
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language].
* Choose one or more datasets to show logs for specific programs, such as
{filebeat} or {fleet-server}.
+

* Change the log level to filter the view by log levels. Want to see debugging
logs? Refer to <<change-logging-level>>.
* Change the time range to view historical logs.
* Click **Open in Logs** to tail agent log files in real time. For more
information about logging, refer to
{observability-guide}/tail-logs.html[Tail log files].

[[change-logging-level]]
= Change the logging level

The logging level for monitored agents is set to `info` by default. You can
change the agent logging level, for example, to turn on debug logging remotely:

. After navigating to the **Logs** tab as described in <<view-agent-logs>>,
scroll down to find the **Agent logging level** setting.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/agent-set-logging-level.png[{Logs} tab showing the agent logging level setting]

. Select an *Agent logging level*:
+
|===
a|`error` | Logs errors and critical errors.
a|`warning`| Logs warnings, errors, and critical errors.
a|`info`| Logs informational messages, including the number of events that are published.
Also logs any warnings, errors, or critical errors.
a|`debug`| Logs debug messages, including a detailed printout of all events flushed. Also
logs informational messages, warnings, errors, and critical errors.
|===

. Click **Apply changes** to apply the updated logging level to the agent.

[discrete]
[[collect-agent-diagnostics]]
= Collect {agent} diagnostics

{fleet} provides the ability to remotely generate and gather an {agent}'s diagnostics bundle.
An agent can gather and upload diagnostics if it is online in a `Healthy` or `Unhealthy` state.
To download the diagnostics bundle for local viewing:

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> {fleet} -> Agents**.

. In the **Host** column, click the agent's name.

. Click the **Diagnostics** tab.

. Click the **Request diagnostics .zip** button.

Any in-progress or previously collected bundles for the {agent} will be listed on this page.

Note that the bundles are stored in {es} and will be removed after 30 days.

[[view-agent-metrics]]
= View {agent} metrics

When agent monitoring is configured to collect metrics (the default), you can
use the **[Elastic Agent] Agent metrics** dashboard in {kib} to view details
about {agent} resource usage, event throughput, and errors. This information can
help you identify problems and make decisions about scaling your deployment.

To view agent metrics:

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> {fleet} -> Agents**.

. In the **Host** column, click the agent's name.

. On the **Agent details** tab, verify that **Monitor metrics** is enabled. If
it's not, refer to <<change-agent-monitoring>>.

. Click **View agent dashboard** to navigate to the
**[Elastic Agent] Agent metrics** dashboard.
+

The dashboard uses standard {kib} visualizations that you can extend to meet
your needs.

[[change-agent-monitoring]]
= Change {agent} monitoring settings

Agent monitoring is turned on by default in the agent policy. To change agent
monitoring settings for all agents enrolled in a specific agent policy:

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> {fleet} -> Agent policies**.

. Click the agent policy to edit it, then click **Settings**.

. Under **Agent monitoring**, deselect (or select) one or both of these
settings: **Collect agent logs** and **Collect agent metrics**.

. Save your changes.

To turn off agent monitoring when creating a new agent policy:

. In the **Create agent policy** flyout, expand **Advanced options**.

. Under **Agent monitoring**, deselect **Collect agent logs** and
**Collect agent metrics**.

. When you're done configuring the agent policy, click **Create agent policy**.
