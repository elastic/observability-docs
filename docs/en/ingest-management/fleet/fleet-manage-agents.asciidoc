//TODO: We need to make our descriptions of Elastic Agent consistent across
//these docs. I'm going to put this in directly (rather than using a tagged
//region for now.)

{agent} is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.

To learn how to add {agent}s to {fleet}, see
<<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.

To manage your {agent}s in {fleet}, in {kib}, go to *Management > Fleet >
Agents*. On the *Agents* tab, you can perform the following actions:


[options,header]
|===
| User action | Result

|<<unenroll-elastic-agent>>
|Unenroll {agent}s from {fleet}.

|<<upgrade-elastic-agent>>
|Upgrade {agent}s to the latest version.

|<<view-elastic-agent-status>>
|View status of {agent}s.

|<<view-elastic-agent-status>>
|View agent logs and metrics.

//TODO: Check to see if bulk operations are available for these actions.

//TODO: Consider moving all the content under this section to one topic. There
//is a lot of content in the topics, though, so I worry about the usability of
//long scrolling topics in our current doc system.
