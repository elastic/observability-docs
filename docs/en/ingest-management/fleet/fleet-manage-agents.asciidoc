//TODO: We need to make our descriptions of Elastic Agent consistent across
//these docs. I'm going to put this in directly (rather than using a tagged
//region for now.)

****
{agent} is a single, unified agent that you deploy to hosts or containers to
collect data and send it to the {stack}. Behind the scenes, {agent} runs the
{beats} shippers or {elastic-endpoint} required for your configuration.

To learn how to add {agent}s to {fleet}, see
<<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.
****

To manage your {agent}s, go to *Management > {fleet} > Agents* in {kib}. On the
*Agents* tab, you can perform the following actions:


[options,header]
|===
| User action | Result

|<<unenroll-elastic-agent>>
|Unenroll {agent}s from {fleet}.

|<<set-enrollment-timeout>>
|Set enrollment timeout to force unenroll inactive {agent}s.

|<<upgrade-elastic-agent>>
|Upgrade {agent}s to the latest version.

|<<view-elastic-agent-status>>
|View the status of {fleet}-managed {agent}s.

|<<elastic-agent-logging>>
|View {agent} logs and set the logging level.

//TODO: Check to see if bulk operations are available for these actions.

//TODO: Consider moving all the content under this section to one topic. There
//is a lot of content in the topics, though, so I worry about the usability of
//long scrolling topics in our current doc system.
