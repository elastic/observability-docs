{fleet} reports these statuses:

|=== 

| *Healthy* | The {agent} is online and running as expected. There are no agent
policy updates or automatic agent binary updates in progress, but the
agent binary may still be out of date.

| *Unhealthy* | The {agent} is online, but requires attention because it's
reporting either agent or integration-level errors.

| *Updating* | The {agent} is online and updating the agent policy, updating the
binary, or enrolling or unenrolling from {fleet}.

| *Offline* | The {agent} has not checked in during the expected time period.

| *Inactive* | The {agent} is no longer enrolled in {fleet}. The agent must reenroll to connect to {fleet} again.

[[view-agent-logs]]
== View agent logs

When {fleet} reports a status like `Offline` or `Unhealthy`, you might want to
view the agent logs to diagnose potential causes. If logging is configured for
the agent:

. Under *Agents*, click the agent name listed in the *Host* column.

. Click the *Logs* tab.
+
On the *Logs* tab you can filter, search, and explore the agent logs.
You can also remotely turn on debug logging by changing the log level.
