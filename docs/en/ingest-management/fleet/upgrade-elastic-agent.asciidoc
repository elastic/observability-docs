Starting with version 7.10, {fleet} provides upgrade capabilities. You can view
and select agents that are out of date, and trigger selected agents to download,
install, and run the new version.

This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you don’t need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.

{agent}s require internet access to perform binary upgrades from {fleet}.

NOTE: The upgrade feature is not supported for upgrading DEB/RPM packages or
Docker images.

To upgrade {agent} to a new version:

. In {fleet}, select **Agents**.

. Under **Agents**, click **Upgrade available** to see a list of agents
that you can upgrade.

. Upgrade your agents:

.. To upgrade a single agent, choose **Upgrade agent** from the **Actions** menu
next to the agent you want to upgrade.

The **Upgrade agent** option is grayed out when an upgrade is unavailable, or
the {kib} version is lower than the agent version.

.. To upgrade multiple agents, bulk select the agents and click
**Upgrade agents**.
+
Unable to select multiple agents? Confirm that your subscription level supports
selective agent binary updates in {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{subscriptions}[{stack} subscriptions].

TIP: Want to upgrade a standalone agent instead? See <<upgrade-standalone>>.

[[upgrade-7.12-lower]]
== Upgrade from 7.12 or lower

As part of the 7.13 release, we introduce <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>>,
a mechanism to connect your {agent}s to {fleet}.

[WARNING]
====
When you upgrade to 7.13 from 7.12 or lower, please note the following:

* All of your existing {agent}s will be automatically unenrolled from {fleet} and will stop sending data.
* Before you can add your {agent}s again to {fleet}, you must have {fleet-server} running.
* All of your policies will be migrated.

[[fleet-prereqs-upgrade]]
=== Prerequisite

You must upgrade your deployment to 7.13. If your deployment is running in our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud}, see {cloud}/ec-upgrade-deployment.html[Upgrade versions]. If you are running a self-managed
deployment, see {stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[Upgrading the {stack}].

=== Step 2: Install and enroll {agent} on more hosts

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you upgrade to 7.13 from 7.12 or lower, you may see the following error message in the {es} logs:

`Authentication using apikey failed - api key has been invalidated`

Before installing and enrolling your {agent}s, make sure to uninstall your previous {agent}s.
See <<uninstall-elastic-agent>>.
====

From the perspective of a host, {fleet-server} will be running with the version of the installed
{agent} that started it. Any other {agent}s enrolling with {fleet-server} must have an equal or
lower version than that of the {fleet-server}.

NOTE: Starting from version 7.13.0 {fleet-server} is required.
