With {fleet} upgrade capabilities, you can view and select agents that are out
of date, and trigger selected agents to download, install, and run the new
version.

This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you donâ€™t need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.

{agent}s require internet access to perform binary upgrades from {fleet}.

NOTE: The upgrade feature is not supported for upgrading DEB/RPM packages or
Docker images.

To upgrade {agent} to a new version:

. In {fleet}, select **Agents**.

. Under **Agents**, click **Upgrade available** to see a list of agents
that you can upgrade.

. Upgrade your agents:

.. To upgrade a single agent, choose **Upgrade agent** from the **Actions** menu
next to the agent you want to upgrade.

The **Upgrade agent** option is grayed out when an upgrade is unavailable, or
the {kib} version is lower than the agent version.

.. To upgrade multiple agents, bulk select the agents and click
**Upgrade agents**.

Unable to select multiple agents? Confirm that your subscription level supports
selective agent binary updates in {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{subscriptions}[{stack} subscriptions].

TIP: Want to upgrade a standalone agent instead? See <<upgrade-standalone>>.
