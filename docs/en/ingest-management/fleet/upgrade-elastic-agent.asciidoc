TIP: Want to upgrade a standalone agent instead? See <<upgrade-standalone>>.

With {fleet} upgrade capabilities, you can view and select agents that are out
of date, and trigger selected agents to download, install, and run the new
version. You can trigger upgrades to happen immediately, or specify a
maintenance window during which the upgrades will occur. If your {stack}
subscription level supports it, you can schedule upgrades to occur at a specific
date and time.

This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you donâ€™t need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.

{agent}s require internet access to perform binary upgrades from {fleet}.

NOTE: The upgrade feature is not supported for upgrading DEB/RPM packages or
Docker images.

To upgrade your {agent}s, go to *Management > {fleet} > Agents* in {kib}. You
can perform the following upgrade-related actions:

[options,header]
|===
| User action | Result

|<<upgrade-an-agent>>
|Upgrade a single agent to a specific version.

|<<rolling-agent-upgrade>>
|Do a rolling upgrade of multiple agents over a specific time period.

|<<schedule-agent-upgrade>>
|Schedule an upgrade of one or more agents to begin at a specific time.

|<<view-upgrade-status>>
|View the status of an upgrade, including upgrade metrics and agent logs.

|<<abort-agent-upgrade>>
|Stop an in-progress upgrade.

//vagrant wouldn't update, then when I aborted, they both went offline. What happens
//to agents that have already upgraded? Is there any rollback process?
