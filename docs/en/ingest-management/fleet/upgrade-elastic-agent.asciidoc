TIP: Want to upgrade a standalone agent instead? See <<upgrade-standalone>>.

With {fleet} upgrade capabilities, you can view and select agents that are out
of date, and trigger selected agents to download, install, and run the new
version. You can trigger upgrades to happen immediately, or specify a
maintenance window during which the upgrades will occur. If your {stack}
subscription level supports it, you can schedule upgrades to occur at a specific
date and time.

In most failure cases the {agent} may retry an upgrade after a short wait. The
wait durations betweem retries are: 1m, 5m,  10m, 15m, 30m, 1h. During this
time, the {agent} may show up as "retrying" in the {fleet} UI. Note that an
upgrade that is being retried may be aborted as detailed below.

This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you don’t need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.

By default, {agent}s require internet access to perform binary upgrades from
{fleet}. However, you can host your own artifacts repository and configure
{agent}s to download binaries from it. For more information, refer to
<<air-gapped>>.

NOTE: The upgrade feature is not supported for upgrading DEB/RPM packages or
Docker images.

To upgrade your {agent}s, go to *Management > {fleet} > Agents* in {kib}. You
can perform the following upgrade-related actions:

[options,header]
