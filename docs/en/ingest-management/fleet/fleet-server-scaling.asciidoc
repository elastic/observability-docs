[[fleet-server-scalability]]
= {fleet-server} scalability

This page summarizes the resource and {fleet-server} configuration
requirements needed to scale your deployment of {agent}s. To scale
{fleet-server}, you need to modify settings in your deployment and the
{fleet-server} agent policy.

First modify your {fleet} deployment settings in {ecloud}:

. Log in to {ecloud} and go to your deployment.

. Under *Deployments > _deployment name_*, click *Edit*.

. Under {integrations-server}:
+
--
* Modify the compute resources available to the server to accommodate a higher
scale of {agent}s
* Modify the availability zones to satisfy fault tolerance requirements

For recommended settings, refer to <<scaling-recommendations>>.

Next modify the {fleet-server} configuration by editing the agent policy: 

. In *{fleet}*, click *Agent Policies*. Click on the *{ecloud} agent policy* to
edit it.

. Open the *Actions* menu and select *Edit integration*.

. Under {fleet-server}, modify *Max Connections* and other
<<fleet-server-configuration,advanced settings>> as described in
<<scaling-recommendations>>.

[[fleet-server-configuration]]
== Advanced {fleet-server} options

The following advanced settings are available to fine tune your {fleet-server}
deployment.

`cache`::

`num_counters`:::
Size of the hash table. Best practice is to have this set to 10x max
connections.

`max_cost`:::
Total size of the cache.

`server.limits`::
`policy_throttle`:::
How often a new policy is rolled out to the agents.

`checkin_limit.interval`:::
How fast the agents can check in to the {fleet-server}.

`checkin_limit.burst`:::
Burst of check-ins allowed before falling back to the rate defined by
`interval`.

`checkin_limit.max`:::
Maximum number of agents.

`artifact_limit.max`:::
Maximum number of agents that can call the artifact API concurrently. It allows
the user to avoid overloading the {fleet-server} from artifact API calls.

`artifact_limit.interval`:::
How often artifacts are rolled out. Default of 100ms allows 10 artifacts to be
rolled out per second.

`artifact_limit.burst`:::
Number of transactions allowed for a burst, controlling oversubscription on
outbound buffer.

`ack_limit.max`:::
Maximum number of agents that can call the Ack API concurrently. It allows the
user to avoid overloading the {fleet-server} from Ack API calls.

`ack_limit.interval`:::
How often an acknowledgment (ACK) is sent. Default value of 10ms enables 100
ACKs per second to be sent.

`ack_limit.burst`:::
Burst of ACKs to accommodate (default of 20) before falling back to the rate
defined in `interval`.

`enroll_limit.max`:::
Maximum number of agents that can call the Enroll API concurrently. This setting
allows the user to avoid overloading the {fleet-server} from Enrollment API
calls.

`enroll_limit.interval`:::
Interval between processing enrollment request. Enrollment is both CPU and RAM
intensive, so the number of enrollment requests needs to be limited for overall
system health. Default value of 100ms allows 10 enrollments per second.

`enroll_limit.burst`:::
Burst of enrollments to accept before falling back to the rate defined by
`interval`.

[[scaling-recommendations]]
== Scaling recommendations ({ecloud})

The following tables provide resource requirements and scaling guidelines based
on the number of agents required by your deployment:

* <<resource-requirements-by-number-agents>>
* <<recommend-settings-scaling-agents>>

// TODO: Confirm that these recommendations are current. The values don't match
// the drop-down lists in the latest version of {ecloud}.
