[[fleet-server-monitoring]]
= {fleet-server} monitoring

Monitoring {fleet-server} is key since the operation of the {fleet-server} is
paramount to the health of the deployed agents and the services they offer. When
{fleet-server} is not operating correctly, it may lead to delayed check-ins,
status information, and updates for the agents it manages. The monitoring data
will tell you when to add capacity for {fleet-server}, and provide error logs
and information to troubleshoot other issues.

To enable monitoring for {fleet-server}, turn on agent monitoring in the agent
policy. For self-managed clusters, monitoring is on by default when you create a
new agent policy or use the existing Default {fleet-server} agent policy.
However, it is off by default in the {ecloud} agent policy because monitoring
requires additional RAM.

To turn on {fleet-server} monitoring in the agent policy:

. In {fleet}, go to *Agent Policies* and click on the *{ecloud} agent policy*.

. Click the *Settings* tab and notice that Agent monitoring is
off by default.

. Under *Agent monitoring*, select *Collect agent logs* and
*Collect agent metrics*.

The agent will now be able to collect logs and metrics from the {fleet-server}.

NOTE: The {fleet-server} is deployed as yet another agent in the system.

. Next, set the *Default namespace*.
+
Setting the default namespace lets you segregate {fleet-server} monitoring data
from other collected data. This makes it easier to search and visualize the
monitoring data. By default the monitoring data is sent to the *default*
namespace.

. To confirm your change, click *Save changes*.

To see the metrics collected for {fleet-server}, go to *Analytics > Discover*.

In the following example, `fleetserver` was configured as the namespace, and
you can see the metrics collected:

In {kib}, go to *Analytics > Dashboard* and search for the predefined dashboard
called *[Elastic Agent] Agent metrics*. Choose this dashboard, and run a query
based on the `fleetserver` namespace.

The following dashboard shows data for the query `data_stream.namespace:
"fleetserver"`. In this example, you can observe CPU and memory usage as a
metric and then resize the {fleet-server}, if necessary.

Note that as an alternative to running the query, you can hide all metrics
except `fleet_server` in the dashboard.
