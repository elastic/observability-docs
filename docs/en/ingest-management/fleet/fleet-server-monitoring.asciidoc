[[fleet-server-monitoring]]
= Monitor a self-managed {fleet-server}

For self-managed {fleet-server}s, monitoring is key because the operation of the
{fleet-server} is paramount to the health of the deployed agents and the
services they offer. When {fleet-server} is not operating correctly, it may lead
to delayed check-ins, status information, and updates for the agents it manages.
The monitoring data will tell you when to add capacity for {fleet-server}, and
provide error logs and information to troubleshoot other issues.

For self-managed clusters, monitoring is on by default when you create a
new agent policy or use the existing Default {fleet-server} agent policy.

To monitor {fleet-server}:

. In {fleet}, go to *Agent Policies* and click the {fleet-server} agent policy.

. Click the *Settings* tab and verify that *Collect agent logs* and
*Collect agent metrics* are selected.

. Next, set the *Default namespace* to something like `fleetserver`.
+
Setting the default namespace lets you segregate {fleet-server} monitoring data
from other collected data. This makes it easier to search and visualize the
monitoring data.

. To confirm your change, click *Save changes*.

To see the metrics collected for the agent running {fleet-server}, go to
*Analytics > Discover*.

In the following example, `fleetserver` was configured as the namespace, and
you can see the metrics collected:

// lint ignore elastic-agent
In {kib}, go to *Analytics > Dashboard* and search for the predefined dashboard
called *[Elastic Agent] Agent metrics*. Choose this dashboard, and run a query
based on the `fleetserver` namespace.

The following dashboard shows data for the query `data_stream.namespace:
"fleetserver"`. In this example, you can observe CPU and memory usage as a
metric and then resize the {fleet-server}, if necessary.

Note that as an alternative to running the query, you can hide all metrics
except `fleet_server` in the dashboard.
