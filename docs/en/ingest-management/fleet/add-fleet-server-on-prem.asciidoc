[[add-fleet-server-on-prem]]
= Deploy on-premises and self-managed

To use {fleet} for central management, a <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> must
be running and accessible to your hosts. Deploying {fleet-server} on-premises
to work with {es} running on-premises is one of <<add-a-fleet-server,several approaches>>
to setting up {fleet-server}.

image::images/fleet-server-on-prem-deployment.png[{fleet-server} on-premises deployment model]

To deploy a self-managed {fleet-server}, you need to: 

* Satisfy all <<add-fleet-server-on-prem-compatibility,compatibility requirements>> and <<add-fleet-server-on-prem-prereq,prerequisites>>
* Add hosts including <<add-fleet-server-on-prem-hosts,{fleet-server} hosts and {es} hosts>>
* <<add-fleet-server-on-prem-add-server,Add {fleet-server}>> by installing an {agent} and enrolling it in an agent policy containing the {fleet-server} integration

NOTE: You can install only a single {agent} per host, which means you cannot run
{fleet-server} and another {agent} on the same host unless you deploy a
containerized {fleet-server}.

[[add-fleet-server-on-prem-compatibility]]
= Compatibility

{fleet-server} is compatible with the following Elastic products:

* {stack} 7.13 or later.
** For version compatibility: {es} >= {fleet-server} >= {agent} (except for
bugfix releases)
** {kib} should be on the same minor version as {es}.

* {ece} 2.9 or later
+
--
** Requires additional wildcard domains and certificates (which normally only
cover `*.cname`, not `*.*.cname`). This enables us to provide the URL for
{fleet-server} of `https://.fleet.`.
** The deployment template must contain an {integrations-server} node.
--
+
For more information about hosting {fleet-server} on {ece}, refer to
{ece-ref}/ece-manage-integrations-server.html[Manage your {integrations-server}].

[[add-fleet-server-on-prem-prereq]]
= Prerequisites

// tag::cert-prereq[]
Before setting up {fleet-server} using this approach, you will need a
Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)
to encrypt traffic between the {fleet-server}s and the {stack}.

If your organization already uses the {stack}, you may already have a CA certificate. If you do not have a CA certificate, you can read more
about generating one in <<secure-connections>>.

NOTE: This is not required when testing and iterating using the *Quick start* option, but should always be used for production deployments.

// end::cert-prereq[]

[[add-fleet-server-on-prem-hosts]]
= Add {fleet-server} hosts

// tag::fleet-server-host-prereq[]
Start by adding one or more {fleet-server} hosts.
A {fleet-server} host is a URL your {agent}s will use to connect to a {fleet-server}.

{fleet-server} hosts should meet the following requirements:

* All agents can connect to the host.
* The host also has a route to the {es} you plan to use.
* The host meets the <<scaling-recommendations,minimum compute resource requirements>> based on the maximum number
of agents you plan to support in your deployment.
// end::fleet-server-host-prereq[]

// tag::add-fleet-server-host[]
To add a {fleet-server} host:

. In {kib}, go to *Management* -> *{fleet}* -> *Settings*.
For more information about these settings, see
{fleet-guide}/fleet-settings.html[{fleet} settings].

. Under *{fleet-server} hosts*, click *Edit hosts* and specify one or more host
URLs your {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}. Save and apply your settings.
+
TIP: If the **Edit hosts** option is grayed out, {fleet-server} hosts
are configured outside of {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{fleet} settings in {kib}].

// end::add-fleet-server-host[]

To update {es} hosts:

// Update up Elasticsearch host (not used in the third deployment model
. In the **Outputs** table:
.. Find the _default_ row where the _Type_ is set to _Elasticsearch_.
.. Click the pencil icon in the _Actions_ column.
.. Update the _Hosts_ field to specify one or more {es} URLs where {agent}s
will send data. For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`.
+
NOTE: Skip this step if you've started the {stack} with security enabled
(you cannot change this setting because it's managed outside of {fleet}).

. Save and apply the settings.

[[add-fleet-server-on-prem-add-server]]
= Add {fleet-server}

A {fleet-server} is an {agent} that is enrolled in a {fleet-server} policy.
The policy configures the agent to operate in a special mode to serve as a {fleet-server} in your deployment.

To add a {fleet-server}:

. Click the **Agents** tab.
. Click *Add {fleet-server}*.
. This will open in-product instructions to add a {fleet-server} using 
one of two options: *Quick Start* or *Advanced*.
* Use *Quick Start* if you want {fleet} to generate a
{fleet-server} policy and enrollment token for you. The {fleet-server} policy
will include a {fleet-server} integration plus a system integration for
monitoring {agent}. This option generates self-signed certificates and is 
*not* recommended for production use cases.
+

image::images/add-fleet-server.png[In-product instructions for adding a {fleet-server} in quick start mode]

* Use *Advanced* if you want to either:
** *Use your own {fleet-server} policy.* {fleet-server} policies manage
and configure the {agent} running on {fleet-server} hosts to launch a
{fleet-server} process. You can create a new {fleet-server} policy or
select an existing one. Alternatively you can
{fleet-guide}/create-a-policy-no-ui.html[create a {fleet-server} policy without using the UI],
and then select the policy here.
** *Use your own TLS certificates.* TLS certificates encrypt traffic between
{agent}s and {fleet-server}. To learn how to generate certs, refer to
{fleet-guide}/secure-connections.html[Configure SSL/TLS for self-managed {fleet-server}s].
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are providing your own certificates:

* Before running the `install` command, make sure you replace the values in
angle brackets. 
* Note that the URL specified by `--url` must match the DNS name used to
generate the certificate specified by `--fleet-server-cert`.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-fleet-server-advanced.png[In-product instructions for adding a {fleet-server} in advanced mode]

. Then, use the in-product instructions to install the {agent}.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy. For more {fleet-server} commands, see
{fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-cmd-options.html[{agent} command reference].
====

. If installation is successful, you'll see confirmation that {fleet-server}
connected. Click **Continue enrolling {agent}** to begin enrolling your
agents in {fleet-server}.

[NOTE]
====
It's recommended you generate a unique service token for each
{fleet-server}. For other ways to generate service tokens, see
{ref}/service-tokens-command.html[`elasticsearch-service-tokens`].

[[add-fleet-server-on-prem-troubleshoot]]
= Troubleshooting

If you're unable to add a {fleet}-managed agent, click the **Agents** tab
and confirm that the agent running {fleet-server} is healthy.

[discrete]
[[add-fleet-server-on-prem-next]]
= Next steps

Now you're ready to add {agent}s to your host systems.
To learn how, see <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.

[NOTE]
====
For on-premises deployments, you can dedicate a policy to all the
agents in the network boundary and configure that policy to include a
specific {fleet-server} (or a cluster of {fleet-server}s).

Read more in <<agent-policy>>.
