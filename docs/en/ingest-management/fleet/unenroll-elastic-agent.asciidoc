[[unenroll-elastic-agent]]
= Unenroll {agent}s

You can unenroll {agent}s to invalidate the API key used to connect to {es}.

. In {fleet}, select *Agents*.

. To unenroll a single agent, choose *Unenroll agent* from the *Actions* menu
next to the agent you want to unenroll.

. To unenroll multiple agents, bulk select the agents and click
*Unenroll agents*.

Unable to select multiple agents? Confirm that your subscription level supports
selective agent unenrollment in {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{subscriptions}[{stack} subscriptions].

Unenrolled agents will continue to run, but will not be able to send data. They
will show this error instead: `invalid api key to authenticate with fleet`.

TIP: If unenrollment hangs, select *Force unenroll* to invalidate all API
keys related to the agent and change the status to `inactive` so that the agent
no longer appears in {fleet}.
