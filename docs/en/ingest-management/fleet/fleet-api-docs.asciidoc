{fleet} is fully supported by an API layer.  Anything you can do in the UI, can be
done using the API.  Indeed, the UI consumes the API and proves out its usage!

Please see the {kib} repo
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/fleet/common/openapi/README.md[{fleet} API Documentation file]
for more details.
