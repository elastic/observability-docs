= {fleet} APIs

{fleet} is fully supported by an API layer. Any actions you can perform
through the {fleet} UI are also available through the API. In fact, the UI
consumes the API.

Please refer to the
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/fleet/common/openapi/README.md[{fleet} OpenAPI file] in the {kib} repo for more details.
