[[fleet-settings]]
= {fleet} UI settings

NOTE: The settings described here are configurable through the {fleet} UI. Refer to
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{fleet} settings in {kib}] for a list of
settings that you can configure in the `kibana.yml` configuration file.

// lint ignore fleet
On the *Settings* tab in *Fleet*, you can configure global settings available
to all {agent}s enrolled in {fleet}. This includes {fleet-server} hosts and
output settings.

[discrete]
[[fleet-server-hosts-setting]]
== {fleet-server} host settings

Click *Edit hosts* and specify the host URLs your {agent}s will use to connect
to a {fleet-server}. This setting is required. On self-managed clusters, you
must specify one or more URLs.

Not sure if {fleet-server} is running? Refer to <<add-a-fleet-server>>.

On {ecloud}, this field is populated automatically. If you are using
Azure Private Link, GCP Private Service Connect, or AWS PrivateLink
and enrolling the {agent} with a private link URL,
ensure that this setting is configured. Otherwise, {agent} will
reset to use a default address instead of the private link URL.

NOTE: If a URL is specified without a port, {kib} sets the port to `80` (http)
or `443` (https).

By default, {fleet-server} is typically exposed on the following ports:

`8220`::
Default {fleet-server} port for self-managed clusters

`443` or `9243`::
Default {fleet-server} port for {ecloud}. View the {fleet} *Settings* tab
to find the actual port that's used.

IMPORTANT: The exposed ports must be open for ingress and egress in the firewall and
networking rules on the host to allow {agent}s to communicate with {fleet-server}.

Specify multiple URLs (click *Add row*) to scale out your deployment and provide
automatic failover. If multiple URLs exist, {fleet} shows the first provided URL
for enrollment purposes. Enrolled {agent}s will connect to the URLs in round
robin order until they connect successfully. 

When a {fleet-server} is added or removed from the list, all agent policies
are updated automatically.

*Examples:*

* `https://192.0.2.1:8220`
* `https://abae718c1276457893b1096929e0f557.fleet.eu-west-1.aws.qa.cld.elstc.co:443`
* `https://[2001:db8::1]:8220`

[[output-settings]]
== Output settings

Add or edit output settings to specify where {agent}s send data. {agent}s
use the default output if you don't select an output in the agent policy.


NOTE: The {ecloud} internal output is locked and cannot be edited. This
output is used for internal routing to reduce external network charges when
using the {ecloud} agent policy. It also provides visibility for
troubleshooting on {ece}.

To add or edit an output:

. Click *Add output* or *Edit*.

. Set the output name and type.

. Specify settings for the output type you selected:
+
* <<es-output-settings>>
* <<ls-output-settings>>

Specify these settings to send data over a secure connection to {ls}. You must
also configure a {ls} pipeline that reads encrypted data from {agent}s and sends
the data to {es}. Follow the in-product steps to configure the {ls} pipeline.
