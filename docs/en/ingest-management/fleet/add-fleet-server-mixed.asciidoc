= Deploy {fleet-server} on-premises and {es} on Cloud

To use {fleet} for central management, a <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> must
be running and accessible to your hosts. Deploying {fleet-server} on-premises to
work with a hosted {ess} is one of <<add-a-fleet-server,several approaches>>
to setting up {fleet-server}.

image::images/fleet-server-on-prem-es-cloud.png[{fleet-server} on-premise and {es} on Cloud deployment model]

To deploy a self-managed {fleet-server} on-premises to work with a hosted {ess},
you need to: 

* Satisfy all <<add-fleet-server-mixed-compatibility,compatibility requirements>> and <<add-fleet-server-mixed-prereq,prerequisites>>
* Add <<fleet-server-add-hosts,{fleet-server} hosts>>
* Create a <<fleet-server-create-policy,{fleet-server} policy>>
* <<fleet-server-add-server,Add {fleet-server}>> by installing an {agent} and enrolling it in an agent policy containing the {fleet-server} integration

[[add-fleet-server-mixed-compatibility]]
= Compatibility

{fleet-server} is compatible with the following Elastic products:

* {stack} 7.13 or later
** For version compatibility: {es} >= {fleet-server} >= {agent} (except for
bugfix releases)
** {kib} should be on the same minor version as {es}

* {ece} 2.9 or later--allows you to use a hosted {fleet-server} on {ecloud}.
+
--
** Requires additional wildcard domains and certificates (which normally only
cover `*.cname`, not `*.*.cname`). This enables us to provide the URL for
{fleet-server} of `https://.fleet.`.
** The deployment template must contain an {integrations-server} node.
--
+
For more information about hosting {fleet-server} on {ece}, refer to
{ece-ref}/ece-manage-integrations-server.html[Manage your {integrations-server}].

[[fleet-server-create-policy]]
= Create a {fleet-server} policy

Next, you'll create a {fleet-server} policy. The {fleet-server} policy manages
and configures the {agent} running on the {fleet-server} host to launch a
{fleet-server} process.

To create a {fleet-server} policy:

. In {kib}, navigate to the **{fleet}** page and go to the **Agent policies** tab.

. Click on the **Create agent policy** button, then:
.. Provide a meaningful name for the policy that will help you identify this {fleet-server} (or cluster) in the future.
.. Ensure you select _Collect system logs and metrics_ so the compute system hosting this {fleet-server} can be monitored. (This is not required, but is highly recommended.)

. After creating the {fleet-server} policy, navigate to the policy itself and click **Add integration**.

. Search for and select the **{fleet-server}** integration.

. Then click **Add {fleet-server}**.

. Configure the {fleet-server}:
.. Expand **Change default**. Because you are deploying this {fleet-server} on-premises,
you need to enter the _Host_ address and _Port_ number, `8220`.
(In our example the {fleet-server} will be installed on the host `10.128.0.46`.)
.. It's recommended that you also enter the _Max agents_ you intend to support with this {fleet-server}.
This can also be modified at a later stage.
This will allow the {fleet-server} to handle the load and frequency of updates being sent to the agent
and ensure a smooth operation in a bursty environment.

[[fleet-server-add-server]]
= Add {fleet-server}s

Now that the policy exists, you can add {fleet-server}s.
A {fleet-server} is an {agent} that is enrolled in a {fleet-server} policy.
The policy configures the agent to operate in a special mode to serve as a {fleet-server} in your deployment.

To add a {fleet-server}:

. Click the **Agents** tab.

. Click *Add {fleet-server}*.

. This will open in-product instructions for adding a {fleet-server} using 
one of two options. Choose *Advanced*.

image::images/add-fleet-server-advanced.png[In-product instructions for adding a {fleet-server} in advanced mode]

. Follow the in-product instructions to add a {fleet-server}.
.. Choose the policy name for this deployment.
.. Choose **Production** as your deployment mode.
+
Production mode is the fully secured mode where TLS certificates ensure a secure communication between {fleet-server} and {es}.
.. Select the {fleet-server} host that was identified earlier. Click **Add host**.
.. A **Service Token** is required so the {fleet-server} can write data to the connected {es} instance.
Click **Generate service token** and copy the generated token.
.. Copy the installation instructions provided in {kib}, which include some of the known deployment parameters.
.. Replace the value of the `--certificate-authorities` parameter with your <<add-fleet-server-mixed-prereq,CA certificate>>.

After {fleet-server} is installed and enrolled in {fleet},
the newly created {fleet-server} policy is applied.
You can see this on the {fleet-server} policy page.

The {fleet-server} agent will also show up on the main {fleet} page as another agent
whose life-cycle can be managed (like other agents in the deployment).

[[fleet-server-install-agents]]
= Next steps

Now you're ready to add {agent}s to your host systems.
To learn how, see <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.

[NOTE]
====
For on-premises deployments, you can dedicate a policy to all the
agents in the network boundary and configure that policy to include a
specific {fleet-server} (or a cluster of {fleet-server}s).
