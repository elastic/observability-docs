[[fleet-server]]
= {fleet-server}

{fleet-server} is a component of the {stack} used to centrally manage {agent}s.
It's launched as part of an {agent} on a host intended to act as a server. One
{fleet-server} process can support many {agent} connections, and serves as a
control plane for updating agent policies, collecting status information, and
coordinating actions across {agent}s.

{fleet-server} is the mechanism {agent}s use to communicate with {es}:

. When a new agent policy is created, it's saved to {es}.

. To enroll in the policy, {agent}s send a request to {fleet-server},
using the enrollment key generated for authentication.

. {fleet-server} receives the request and gets the agent policy from {es},
then ships the policy to all {agent}s enrolled in that policy.

. {agent} uses configuration information in the policy to collect and send data
to {es}.

. {agent} checks into {fleet-server} for updates, maintaining an open connection.

. When a policy is updated, {fleet-server} retrieves the updated policy from
{es} and sends it to the connected {agent}s.

image:images/fleet-server-communication.png[{fleet-server} handles communication between {agent}, {fleet}, {es}, and {kib}]

{fleet-server} runs as a subprocess inside an {agent}. The agent uses a special
policy that describes the {fleet-server} configuration. In large scale
self-managed deployments or on {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud},
{fleet-server} is typically run as a dedicated {agent} communication host, but
you can optionally use it for data collection on self-managed clusters. For more
details, refer to <<fleet-server-scalability>>.

== Service account

{fleet-server} uses a service token to communicate with {es}, which contains
a `fleet-server` service account. Each {fleet-server} can use its own service
token, and you can share it across multiple servers (not recommended). The
advantage of using a separate token for each server is that you can invalidate
each one separately.

You can create a service token by either using the {fleet} UI or the {es} API.
