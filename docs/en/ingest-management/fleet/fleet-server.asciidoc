beta[]

{fleet-server} is a component of the {stack} used to centrally manage {agent}s.
It's launched as part of an {agent} on a host intended to act as a server.
One {fleet-server} process can support many {agent} connections,
and serves as a control plane for updating agent policies, collecting
status information, and coordinating actions across {agent}s.

{fleet-server} is the mechanism {agent}s use to communicate with {es}:

. When a new agent policy is created, it's saved to {es}.

. To enroll in the policy, {agent}s send a request to {fleet-server},
using the enrollment key generated for authentication.

. {fleet-server} receives the request and gets the agent policy from {es},
then ships the policy to all {agent}s enrolled in that policy.

. {agent} uses configuration information in the policy to collect and send data
to {es}.

. {fleet-server} periodically checks {agent}s for status information.

. When a policy is updated, {fleet-server} retrieves the updated policy from
{es} and sends it to the connected {agent}s.

image:images/fleet-server-communication.png[Fleet Server handles communication between {agent}, {fleet}, {es}, and {kib}]

{fleet-server} runs as a subprocess inside an {agent}. The agent uses a special
policy that describes the {fleet-server} configuration. In large scale
self-managed deployments or on {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud},
{fleet-server} is typically run as a dedicated {agent} communication host, but
you can optionally use it for data collection on self-managed clusters. For more
details, refer to <<fleet-server-deployment>>.

[[fleet-server-compatibility]]
== Compatibility

{fleet-server} is compatible with the following Elastic products:

* {stack} 7.13 or later (our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud} or
a self-managed cluster).

* {ece} 2.10 or later

//TODO: Confirm that ECE version shown here is correct ^^.

{fleet-server} is supported on x64 architectures only.

[[add-fleet-server]]
== Add a {fleet-server}

Before using {fleet} for central management, {fleet-server} must be running. The
steps for running {fleet-server} on our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud}
are different from the steps for running it on a self-managed cluster.

Now you're ready to add {agent}s to your host systems. To learn how, see
<<add-agent-to-fleet>>.

//TODO: Describe other installation options (like using the enroll
// command rather than installing as service) and point to that info.

[[fleet-server-deployment]]
== Scale your {fleet-server} deployment

coming[a future update]

//TODO: Describe how to scale up the number of {agent}s that can be managed in
// {fleet} by deploying more Fleet Servers. Document limits and recommendations.
// Also describe deployment options (like adding a load balancer)

//needed to render tab widgets
