[[deployment-models]]
= {fleet-server} deployment models

Administrators deploying the {agent} have a few deployment choices
available to satisfy their organization's requirements. {fleet-server} can be
deployed:

* On {ecloud}, as part of our hosted {ess}, which is managed by Elastic, or
* On-premises and self-managed

[[deployed-in-cloud]]
== Deployed in {ecloud}

To simplify the deployment of {agent}, the {fleet-server} can be
provisioned and hosted in the {ecloud}. In this case, when the deployment is
created, a highly available set of {fleet-server}s are automatically deployed.

Administrators can choose the resources allocated to the {fleet-server} and
whether they want the {fleet-server} to be deployed in multiple availability
zones.

Once deployed on {ecloud} as a service, the full life cycle of the
{fleet-server} is managed by Elastic. {fleet-server} is scalable and highly
available with traffic ingress load balanced across multiple instances to
satisfy the scale requirements.

[[deployed-on-prem]]
== Deployed on-premises and self-managed

{fleet-server} can be deployed on-premises and managed by the user. In this
deployment model, the administrator is responsible for {fleet-server} deployment
and lifecycle management. This mode of operation is predominantly chosen to
satisfy data governance requirements or used in scenarios where the agents only
have access to a private segmented network.

It’s recommended that the administrator provision multiple instances of the
{fleet-server} and use a load balancer to better scale the deployment.

== {fleet-server} High availability operations

{fleet-server} is stateless. Connections to the {fleet-server} therefore can be
load balanced as long as the {fleet-server} has capacity to accept more
connections. Load balancing is done on a round-robin basis.

In the {ecloud} deployment model, multiple {fleet-server}s are automatically
provisioned to satisfy the instance size chosen (instance sizes are modified to
satisfy the scale requirement). In addition, if you choose multiple
availability zones to address your fault-tolerance requirements, those
instances are also utilized to balance the load.

In an on-premises deployment, high-availability, fault-tolerance, and lifecycle
management of the {fleet-server} are the responsibility of the administrator.
