[%collapsible]

Each input in an agent policy must have a unique ID, like `id: my-unique-input-id`.
This change only affects standalone agents. Unique IDs are automatically generated in
agent policies managed by {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{agent-pull}/1994[#1994]

*Impact* +
Make sure that your standalone agent policies have a unique ID.

.Diagnostics `--pprof` argument has been removed and is now always provided
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `diagnostics` command gathers diagnostic information about the {agent} and
each component/unit it runs. Starting in 8.6.0, the `--pprof`
argument is no longer available because `pprof` information is now always
provided. For more information, refer to {agent-pull}1140[#1140].

*Impact* +
Remove the `--pprof` argument from any scripts or commands you use.
