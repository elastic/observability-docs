[[known-issue-issue-2066-8-6-1]]
.Osquery live query results can take up to five minutes to show up in {kib}
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
A known issue in {agent} may prevent live query results from being available
in the {kib} UI even though the results have been successfully sent to {es}. 
For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2066[#2066].

*Impact* +
Be aware that the live query results shown in {kib} may be delayed by up to 5 minutes.

[[known-issue-2170]]
.Adding a {fleet-server} integration to an agent results in panic if the agent was not bootstrapped with a {fleet-server}
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

A panic occurs because the {agent} does not have a `fleet.server` in the `fleet.enc`
configuration file. When this happens, the agent fails with a message like:

[source,shell]
----
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x8 pc=0x557b8eeafc1d]
goroutine 86 [running]:
github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/internal/pkg/agent/application.FleetServerComponentModifier.func1({0xc000652f00, 0xa, 0x10}, 0x557b8fa8eb92?)
...
----

For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2170[#2170].

*Impact* +

To work around this problem, uninstall the {agent} and install it again with
{fleet-server} enabled during the bootstrap process.

[[breaking-changes-8.6.0]]
=== Breaking changes

Breaking changes can prevent your application from optimal operation and
performance. Before you upgrade, review the breaking changes, then mitigate the
impact to your application.

[discrete]
[[breaking-1994]]
.Each input in an agent policy must have a unique ID 
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Each input in an agent policy must have a unique ID, like `id: my-unique-input-id`.
This change only affects standalone agents. Unique IDs are automatically generated in
agent policies managed by {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{agent-pull}/1994[#1994]

*Impact* +
Make sure that your standalone agent policies have a unique ID.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-1140]]
.Diagnostics `--pprof` argument has been removed and is now always provided
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `diagnostics` command gathers diagnostic information about the {agent} and
each component/unit it runs. Starting in 8.6.0, the `--pprof`
argument is no longer available because `pprof` information is now always
provided. For more information, refer to {agent-pull}1140[#1140].

*Impact* +
Remove the `--pprof` argument from any scripts or commands you use.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-1398]]
.Not dedoted Kubernetes pod labels to be used for autodiscover conditions
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Kubernetes pod labels used in autodiscover conditions are not dedoted anymore. This means that
`.` are not replaced with `_` in labels like `app.kubernetes.io/component=controller`.
This follows the same approach as kubernetes annotations. For more information refer to <<kubernetes-provider>>.

*Impact* +
Any template used for standalone elastic agent or installed integration that makes use
of dedoted kubernetes labels inside conditions has to be updated.

*Details* +
A known issue in {agent} may prevent live query results from being available
in the {kib} UI even though the results have been successfully sent to {es}. 
For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2066[#2066].

*Impact* +

====

[[known-issue-issue-2086]]
.Beats started by agent may fail with `output unit has no config` error
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
A known issue in {agent} may lead to Beat processes being started without a
valid output. To correct the problem, trigger a restart of {agent}
or the affected Beats. For Beats managed by {agent}, you can trigger a restart by changing the
{agent} log level or the output section of the {agent} policy.
For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2086[#2086].

*Impact* +
{agent} will appear unhealthy and the affected Beats will not be able to write
event data to {es} or Logstash.
