[[known-issue-issue-2066-8-6-2]]
.Osquery live query results can take up to five minutes to show up in {kib}.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
A known issue in {agent} may prevent live query results from being available
in the {kib} UI even though the results have been successfully sent to {es}.
For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2066[#2066].

*Impact* +
Be aware that the live query results shown in {kib} may be delayed by up to 5 minutes.
====

[[known-issue-2170-8-6-2]]
.Adding a {fleet-server} integration to an agent results in panic if the agent was not bootstrapped with a {fleet-server}.
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

A panic occurs because the {agent} does not have a `fleet.server` in the `fleet.enc`
configuration file. When this happens, the agent fails with a message like:

[source,shell]
----
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x8 pc=0x557b8eeafc1d]

...
----

For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2170[#2170].

*Impact* +

To work around this problem, uninstall the {agent} and install it again with
{fleet-server} enabled during the bootstrap process.
====

[[known-issue-issue-2103-8.6.2]]
.Installing {agent} on MacOS Ventura may fail if Full Disk Access has not been granted to the application used for installation.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
This issue occurs on MacOS Ventura when Full Disk Access is not granted to the application that runs the installation command.
This could be either a Terminal or any custom package that a user has built to distribute {agent}.

For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2103[#2103].

*Impact* +
{agent} will fail to install and produce "Error: failed to fix permissions: chown elastic-agent.app: operation not permitted" message.
Ensure that the application used to install {agent} (for example, the Terminal or custom package) has Full Disk Access before running `sudo ./elastic-agent install`.
====

[[known-issue-issue-2342-8.6.2]]
.{agent} upgrades scheduled for a future time do not run.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
A known issue in {agent} may prevent upgrades scheduled to execute at a later time from running.
For more information refer to {agent-issue}2342[#2342].

*Impact* +
{kib} may show an agent as being stuck with the `Updating` status.
If the scheduled start time has passed, you may force the agent to run by sending it any action (excluding an upgrade action), such as a change to the policy or the log level.
====

[[known-issue-issue-2303-8.6.2]]
.{fleet} ignores custom `server.*` attributes provided through integration settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
{fleet} will ignore any custom `server.*` attributes provided through the custom configurations yaml block of the intgration.
For more information refer to {fleet-server-issue}2303[#2303].

*Impact* +
Custom yaml settings are silently ignored by {fleet}.
Settings with input blocks, such as Max agents are still effective.

[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

Upgrade to 8.6.2 to fix the problem. For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2232[#2232].

[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

{fleet-server} will crash when configured to use the Warning log level. Do not use the Warning log level.
Affected {fleet-server} instances must be reinstalled to fix the problem.

Upgrade to 8.6.2 to fix the problem. For more information, refer to {fleet-server-issue}2328[#2328].
====

[[known-issue-issue-unsigned-8.6.1]]
.The initial release of {agent} 8.6.1 for MacOS contained an unsigned elastic-agent executable. On MacOS Ventura, upgrading from 8.6.1 to any other version will fail and can disable Elastic Defend protections.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The initial release of {agent} version 8.6.1 for MacOS contained an unsigned elastic-agent executable and a correctly signed endpoint-security
executable. The endpoint-security executable implements the endpoint protection functionality of the Elastic Defend integration.

New functionality in MacOS Gatekeeper in MacOS Ventura prevents the unsigned elastic-agent executable from modifying the installation of the signed endpoint-security executable causing upgrades from affected 8.6.1 versions to fail. The failed upgrade can leave {agent} in an unhealthy
state with the endpoint-security executable disabled. Note that MacOS Gatekeeper implements a signature cache, such that the upgrade is only likely to fail on MacOS Ventura machines that have been rebooted since the first upgrade to version 8.6.1.

As of February 27th 2023 the {agent} 8.6.1 artifacts for MacOS have been updated with a correctly signed elastic-agent executable. To verify that
the signature of the elastic-agent executable is correct, run the command below and ensure that Elasticsearch, Inc appears in the Authority field.

[source,shell]
----
tar xvfz elastic-agent-8.6.1-darwin-aarch64.tar.gz
cd elastic-agent-8.6.1-darwin-aarch64
codesign -dvvvv ./elastic-agent
...
Signature size=9068
Authority=Developer ID Application: Elasticsearch, Inc (2BT3HPN62Z)
Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
Authority=Apple Root CA
Timestamp=Feb 24, 2023 at 4:33:02 AM
...
----

*Impact* +
Any {agent} deployed to MacOS Ventura that was upgraded to version 8.6.1 prior to February 27th 2023 must be reinstalled using a version with correctly signed executables.
Upgrades to any other version will fail and lead to broken functionality, including disabling the protections from Elastic Defend.

The specific steps to follow to correct this problem are:

1. Download a version of {agent} with correctly signed executables.
2. Unenroll the affected agents, either from the command line or the Fleet UI. A new agent ID will be generated when reinstalling.
3. Run the `elastic-agent uninstall` command to remove the incorrectly signed version of {agent}.
4. From the directory containing the new, correctly signed {agent} artifacts run the `elastic-agent install` command. The agent may be reenrolled at install time or separately with the `elastic-agent enroll` command.

.Each input in an agent policy must have a unique ID
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Each input in an agent policy must have a unique ID, like `id: my-unique-input-id`.
This change only affects standalone agents. Unique IDs are automatically generated in
agent policies managed by {fleet}. For more information, refer to

*Details* +
The `diagnostics` command gathers diagnostic information about the {agent} and
each component/unit it runs. Starting in 8.6.0, the `--pprof`
argument is no longer available because `pprof` information is now always
provided. For more information, refer to {agent-pull}1140[#1140].
