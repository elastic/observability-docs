.During package upgrade, legacy component templates are not removed
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

In 8.2.0, when you upgrade an existing package, legacy `@settings` and
`@mappings` component templates are not removed. These templates are deprecated
in favor of the new `@package` component template. 

*Impact* +

The legacy templates do not cause issues, but you might want to deleted them
because they are no longer used.

To find and delete legacy component templates:

. In {kib}, go to *{stack-manage-app} > Index Management* and click
*Component Templates*.

. Click `Not in use` to filter out component templates that are still in use.

. If the list contains component templates that end in `@mappings` or
`@settings`, use the Actions menu to delete them.
