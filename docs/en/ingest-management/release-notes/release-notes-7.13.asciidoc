*Impact* +
To run and manage Elastic Agents, use the Fleet Server instead of {kib}. For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[Fleet Server].

.`fleet_enroll` role and user no longer needed and should be removed
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

The `fleet_enroll` role and user are no longer needed for central management
of {agent}s in {kib}.

*Impact* +
If the role and user were set up in a previous release, remove them now to avoid
them being orphaned in the cluster. {kib-pull}98745[#98745]
====

[[known-issue-25773]]
.{agent}s unenrolling from a self-managed {fleet-server} hang at "Updating" and API keys are not invalidated
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

In {kib}, when you unenroll an {agent} from a self-managed {fleet-server},
the status may hang at "Updating". This problem only occurs with {agent}s
connecting to a {fleet-server} started with a service token.

*Impact* +
You must do a force unenroll to remove the {agent} and invalidate the API keys,
or unenrollment hangs indefinitely. {fleet-server-issue}380[#380]
