== {fleet} and {agent} 8.7.0

Review important information about the {fleet} and {agent} 8.7.0 release.

[discrete]
[[breaking-changes-8.7.0]]
=== Breaking changes

Breaking changes can prevent your application from optimal operation and
performance. Before you upgrade, review the breaking changes, then mitigate the
impact to your application.

[discrete]
[[breaking-147616]]
.Remove the current_upgrades endpoint
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `api/fleet/current_upgrades` endpoint has been removed. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}147616[#147616].

*Impact* +
When you upgrade to 8.7.0, use the `/action_status` endpoint.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-147199]]
.Remove the preconfiguration API route
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `/api/fleet/setup/preconfiguration` API, which was released as generally available by error, has been removed. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}147199[#147199].

*Impact* +
Do not use `/api/fleet/setup/preconfiguration`. To manage preconfigured agent policies, use `kibana.yml`. For more information, check link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/fleet-settings-kb.html#_preconfiguration_settings_for_advanced_use_cases[Preconfigured settings].

[[known-issues-8.6.2]]
=== Known issues

[discrete]
[[known-issue-issue-2066-8-6-2-2]]
.Osquery live query results can take up to five minutes to show up in {kib}.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
A known issue in {agent} may prevent live query results from being available
in the {kib} UI even though the results have been successfully sent to {es}.
For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2066[#2066].

*Impact* +
Be aware that the live query results shown in {kib} may be delayed by up to 5 minutes.
====

[[known-issue-2170-8-6-2-2]]
.Adding a {fleet-server} integration to an agent results in panic if the agent was not bootstrapped with a {fleet-server}.
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

A panic occurs because the {agent} does not have a `fleet.server` in the `fleet.enc`
configuration file. When this happens, the agent fails with a message like:

[source,shell]
----
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x8 pc=0x557b8eeafc1d]
goroutine 86 [running]:
github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/internal/pkg/agent/application.FleetServerComponentModifier.func1({0xc000652f00, 0xa, 0x10}, 0x557b8fa8eb92?)
...
----

For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2170[#2170].

*Impact* +

To work around this problem, uninstall the {agent} and install it again with
{fleet-server} enabled during the bootstrap process.
====

[[known-issue-2433-8-6-2-2]]
.There is a known issue when upgrading {agent}s to 8.7.0 that are running Osquery.
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* +
{agent}s that have the Osquery Manager integration installed can get stuck in an "Updating" state. 
For more information, refer to {agent-issue}2433[#2433].

*Impact* +
Users can do the following work around the issue:

* Wait for the 8.7.1 release to upgrade {agent}s to the 8.7.x line.
* Remove the Osquery Manager integration before upgrading. After the {agent} has upgraded to 8.7.0, add the Osquery Manager integration back to the {agent}.
* If you encounter this issue and {agent}s are stuck in the "Updating" phase, remove the Osquery Manager integration, upgrade the {agent}, and then add it back.

NOTE: you may need to use the {agent} upgrade API in this scenario instead of the UI.
