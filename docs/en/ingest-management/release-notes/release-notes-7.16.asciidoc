[[known-issues-7.16.0]]
=== Known issues

[[known-issue-121059]]
.Naming conflict during agent policy creation may result in policy with no system integration
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

There is a bug in the logic used to create unique integration policy names. If you edit a system integration in an existing agent policy, and then try to create a new agent policy with *Collect logs and metrics* selected, you'll see the error message, "There is already a package with the same name". {kib-pull}121059[#121059]

*Impact*

The new agent policy will be created, but it will not include the system integration, and it will be unable to collect logs and metrics. 

*Workaround*

You can either:

* Manually add the system integration after creating the agent policy
* Rename the other system integration policies and use unique names

====

[[known-issue-unique-names]]
.Integration policy names must be globally unique
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

Starting in 7.16.0, integration policy names must be globally unique.

*Impact*

If you are upgrading from a previous version and have integrations with
duplicate names, you'll encounter an error when you attempt to upgrade the
integration: "There is already a package with the same name."

*Workaround*

You must modify all integration policy names to be unique before trying to
upgrade integrations.
