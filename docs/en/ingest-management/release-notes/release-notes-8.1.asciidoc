[[known-issues-8.1.0]]
=== Known issues

[[known-issue-108456]]
.Default agent policy is no longer created automatically
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

In prior releases, we provided a default agent policy to make it easier for you
to get started quickly. Starting in 8.1.0, the default policy is no longer
created automatically; instead, you need to create it explicitly.

*Impact* +

The default policy is no longer available, but we make it easy to create one. To
create a default policy, do one of the following:

* In the *Add agent* flyout, click the *Create policy* button. If
*Collect system logs and metrics* is selected, {fleet} will create a policy that
includes the system integration.

* Use the {fleet} API or preconfiguration to create the policy. To learn how,
refer to <<create-a-policy-no-ui>>.

[[known-issue-108456-2]]
.For self-managed deployments, {fleet-server} policy is no longer created automatically
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

In prior releases, we provided a default {fleet-server} policy. Starting in
8.1.0, the default {fleet-server} policy is no longer created automatically for
self-managed deployments; instead, you need to create it explicitly.

The Elastic Cloud agent policy is not changed; it is still available by default
when using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}.

*Impact* +

The default {fleet-server} policy is no longer available, but we make it easy to
create one. To create a {fleet-server} policy, do one of the following:

* Use {fleet} to <<create-a-policy-no-ui,Create a policy>> and
<<add-integration,add a {fleet-server} integration>> to it.

* Use the {fleet} API or preconfiguration to create the policy. To learn how,
refer to <<create-a-policy-no-ui>>.
