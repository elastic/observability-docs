.{agent} upgrade may fail with agent binary verification error
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

During an {agent} upgrade, agent binary verification may fail with the following
message:

[source,text]
----
[elastic_agent][error] failed to dispatch actions, error: failed verification of agent binary: 2 errors occurred:
fetching asc file from '/opt/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent-7f30bb/downloads/elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.asc': open /opt/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent-7f30bb/downloads/elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.asc: no such file or directory
open /opt/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent-7f30bb/downloads/elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512: no such file or directory
----

This is the result of a https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/275[known issue].

*Impact* +

After upgrade, the agent status changes to `Unhealthy`, and {agent} no longer
sends data. To fix this problem:

* If you are using {agent} version 8.1.0 or earlier, continue using that
version until you can upgrade directly to 8.2.x.
* If you are using an affected version of {agent}, reinstall a non-affected
version.

[[known-issue-108456]]
.Default agent policy is no longer created automatically
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

In prior releases, we provided a default agent policy to make it easier for you
to get started quickly. Starting in 8.1.0, the default policy is no longer
created automatically; instead, you need to create it explicitly.

*Impact* +

The default policy is no longer available, but we make it easy to create one. To
create a default policy, do one of the following:

* In the *Add agent* flyout, click the *Create policy* button. If
*Collect system logs and metrics* is selected, {fleet} will create a policy that
includes the system integration.

* Use the {fleet} API or preconfiguration to create the policy. To learn how,
refer to <<create-a-policy-no-ui>>.

.For self-managed deployments, {fleet-server} policy is no longer created automatically
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

In prior releases, we provided a default {fleet-server} policy. Starting in
8.1.0, the default {fleet-server} policy is no longer created automatically for
self-managed deployments; instead, you need to create it explicitly.

The {ecloud} agent policy is not changed; it is still available by default
when using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}.

*Impact* +

The default {fleet-server} policy is no longer available, but we make it easy to
create one. To create a {fleet-server} policy, do one of the following:

* Use {fleet} to <<create-a-policy-no-ui,Create a policy>> and
<<add-integration,add a {fleet-server} integration>> to it.

* Use the {fleet} API or preconfiguration to create the policy. To learn how,
refer to <<create-a-policy-no-ui>>.
