[[known-issue-144880]]
.Unable to add {fleet-server} integration on Windows
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

We discovered a high severity issue in version 8.5.1 that only affects Windows
users in self-managed environments. When you attempt to add a {fleet-server},
{kib} is unable to add the {fleet-server} integration, and the {fleet-server}
polices are created without the necessary integration. For more information,
see {kib-issue}/144880[issue #144880].

*Impact* +

This issue will be resolved in version 8.5.2. We advise Windows users not to
upgrade to version 8.5.1.
