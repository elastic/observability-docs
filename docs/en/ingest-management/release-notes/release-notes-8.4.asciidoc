.Credentials error prevents {agent} from ingesting AWS logs
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

{agent}s configured to use the AWS S3 and SQS integrations may return the
following error:

[source,shell]
----
sqs ReceiveMessage failed: operation error SQS: ReceiveMessage, https response
error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: cb57783a-505f-5099-9160-23b8eea8ddbb,
api error SignatureDoesNotMatch: Credential should be scoped to a valid region. 
----

This error was introduced by a breaking change in the AWS library.

*Impact* +

{agent} is unable to ingest AWS logs and some metrics. To resolve this error:

* If you are using the default domain `amazonaws.com`, upgrade the AWS
integration package to version 1.23.4 to apply the temporary fix added in
https://github.com/elastic/integrations/pull/4103[PR #4103].
* Otherwise, wait to upgrade until the permanent fix added by
https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/32921[PR #32921] is available in an
upcoming stack release.

When you configure `setxpack.fleet.agents.fleet_server.hosts` and `xpack.fleet.agents.elasticsearch.hosts` in kibana.yml, you are unable to update the fields on the Fleet UI.
For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}135669[#135669].
