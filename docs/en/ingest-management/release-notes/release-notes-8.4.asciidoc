// tag::credentials-error[]
.Credentials error prevents {agent} from ingesting AWS logs
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

{agent}s configured to use the AWS integration may return an error similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----
sqs ReceiveMessage failed: operation error SQS: ReceiveMessage, https response
error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: cb57783a-505f-5099-9160-23b8eea8ddbb,
api error SignatureDoesNotMatch: Credential should be scoped to a valid region. 
----

This error was introduced by a breaking change in the AWS library.

*Impact* +

{agent} is unable to ingest AWS logs and some metrics. To resolve this error:

* If you are using the default domain `amazonaws.com`, upgrade the AWS
integration package to version 1.23.4 to apply the temporary fix added in
https://github.com/elastic/integrations/pull/4103[PR #4103]. If this does not
solve your problem, set the AWS region (either from an environment variable,
credentials or instance profile) where {agent} is running.
* Otherwise, wait to upgrade until the permanent fix added by
https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/32921[PR #32921] is available in an
upcoming stack release.

.xpack.agents.* are uneditable in UI when defined in kibana.yml
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
When you configure `setxpack.fleet.agents.fleet_server.hosts` and `xpack.fleet.agents.elasticsearch.hosts` in kibana.yml, you are unable to update the fields on the Fleet UI.
For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}135669[#135669].

*Impact* +
To configure `setxpack.fleet.agents.fleet_server.hosts` and `xpack.fleet.agents.elasticsearch.hosts` on the Fleet UI, avoid configuring the settings in kibana.yml.
