.Credentials potentially exposed in `.fleet-*` and `.kibana*` indices
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

// tag::credential-storage[]

Credentials that you provide for an agent or integration policy are stored in
{es}. They can be read by any user who has read permissions to the `.fleet-*`
and `.kibana*` indices in {es}. By default these are the superuser,
`fleet-server` service account tokens, and the `kibana_system` user. These
secrets are also included in agent policies and shared with agents via {fleet}
through TLS. When you use the {agent} installer and enroll agents in {fleet},
the policies are stored on the host file system and, by default, can only be
read by root.

// end::credential-storage[]

*Impact* +

To avoid exposing secrets, restrict access to the `.fleet-*` and `.kibana*`
indices to trusted users. Do not change file ownership or permissions on policy
files stored on the host file system unless you can secure the files from
malicious users.

//Jason: ^^ Example of what you might want to say in the impace section.
//Also, is there a tracking issue we can refer to here? We usually add a link to
//related GitHub issue.
