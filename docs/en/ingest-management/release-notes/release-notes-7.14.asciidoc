[[known-issues-7.14.0]]
=== Known issues

[[known-issue-1]]
.Credentials potentially exposed in `.fleet-*` and `.kibana*` indices
[%collapsible]
====

*Details* 

// tag::credential-storage[]

Credentials that you provide for an agent or integration policy are stored in
{es}. They can be read by any user who has read permissions to the `.fleet-*`
and `.kibana*` indices in {es}. By default these are the superuser,
`fleet-server` service account tokens, and the `kibana_system` user. These
secrets are also included in agent policies and shared with agents via {fleet}
through TLS. When you use the {agent} installer and enroll agents in {fleet},
the policies are stored on the host file system and, by default, can only be
read by root.

// end::credential-storage[]

*Impact* +

To avoid exposing secrets, restrict access to the `.fleet-*` and `.kibana*`
indices to trusted users. Do not change file ownership or permissions on policy
files stored on the host file system unless you can secure the files from
malicious users.

[[known-issue-27114]]
.{agent} fails to start correctly when enrolled in {fleet} through a proxy
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

When you attempt to enroll an {agent} in {fleet} and specify the `proxy-url`
flag, the status of the agent hangs at `Updating` in {fleet}, and the
{agent} fails to start correctly. 

*Impact* +

Do not enroll {agent}s through a proxy until this issue is fixed.

[[known-issue-938]]
.{fleet-server} policy setup failure may result in {fleet} not starting
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

// tag::fleet-server-input-missing-detail[]

During setup of the default {fleet-server} policy, an error may occur, such
as a network error or connectivity issue, that results in a default policy with
no input. {fleet} will be unable to start.

// end::fleet-server-input-missing-detail[]

*Impact* +

// tag::fleet-server-input-missing-fix[]

To fix this problem:

. Delete the default {fleet-server} policy saved object:

.. In {kib}, open the main menu, then go to **Management > {dev-tools-app} > Console**.

.. In the Console, send the following requests:
+
[source,console]
----
POST .kibana/_delete_by_query?q=ingest-agent-policies.is_default_fleet_server:true
DELETE .kibana/_doc/ingest-agent-policies:policy-elastic-agent-on-cloud
POST .fleet-enrollment-api-keys/_delete_by_query?q=policy-elastic-agent-on-cloud
----

. Go to **Management > {fleet}** to force reloading of the object.

. On {ecloud} you might need to restart the APM and {fleet-server} instances.
