[[breaking-changes-8.0.0]]
=== Breaking changes

Breaking changes can prevent your application from optimal operation and
performance. Before you upgrade, review the breaking changes, then mitigate the
impact to your application.

[discrete]
[[breaking-29458]]
.{fleet-server} can no longer use username and password to authenticate with {es}
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Starting in 8.0, {es} has removed write access to system indices by the
superuser. Therefore, {fleet-server} can no longer use a username and password
to authenticate with {es}. For more information, refer to
{agent-pull}29458[#29458].

*Impact* +
If you run a self-managed {fleet-server} that authenticates with {es} through a
username and password, you must update the configuration to use a {fleet-server}
service token instead. For more information, see <<add-a-fleet-server>>.

[[breaking-28006]]
.`IncludeCreatorMetadata` removed from Kubernetes metadata config options
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The deprecated and undocumented `IncludeCreatorMetadata` setting has been
removed from the Kubernetes metadata config options. For more information, refer
to {agent-pull}28006[#28006].

*Impact* +
This change is unlikely to impact existing users because the setting was never
documented. However, if your config uses this setting, you must remove it now.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-118854]]
.Splits package policy `upgrade` endpoint for {fleet}
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
For package policy upgrades, the packagePolicy `upgrade` endpoint format
supports a mutative upgrade operation (when `dryRun: false`) and a read-only dry
run operation (when `dryRun: true`):

[source,text]
--
 POST /package_policies/upgrade
 {
   packagePolicyIds: [...],
   dryRun: false
 }
--

For more information, refer to {kib-pull}118854[#118854].

*Impact* +
The endpoint is now split into two separate endpoints:

[source,text]
--
 POST /package_policies/upgrade
 {
   packagePolicyIds: [...]
 }

 POST /package_policies/upgrade/dry_run
 {
   packagePolicyIds: [...]
 }
--

[discrete]
[[deprecations-8.0.0]]
=== Deprecations

Deprecated functionality does not have an immediate impact on your application,
but we strongly recommend you make the necessary updates after you complete the
upgrade.

[[deprecation-119494]]
.Updates Fleet API to improve consistency
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The Fleet API has been updated to improve consistency:

* Hyphens are changed to underscores in some names.
* The `pkgkey` path parameter in the packages endpoint is split.
* The `response` and `list` properties are renamed to `items` or `item` in some
responses.

For more information, refer to {kib-pull}119494[#119494].

*Impact* +
When you upgrade to 8.0.0, use the following API changes:

* Use `enrollment_api_keys` instead of `enrollment-api-keys`.

* Use `agent_status` instead of `agent-status`.

* Use `service_tokens` instead of `service-tokens`.

* Use `/epm/packages/{packageName}/{version}` instead of `/epm/packages/{pkgkey}`.

* Use `items[]` instead of `response[]` in:
+
[source,text]
--
/api/fleet/enrollment_api_keys
/api/fleet/agents
/epm/packages/
/epm/categories
/epm/packages/_bulk
/epm/packages/limited
/epm/packages/{packageName}/{version} <1>
--
<1> Use `items[]` when the verb is `POST` or `DELETE`. Use `item` when the verb
is `GET` or `PUT`.

For more information, refer to <<fleet-api-docs>>.
