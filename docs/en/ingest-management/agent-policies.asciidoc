A {policy} is a collection of inputs and settings that defines the data to be collected
by {agent}. Each {agent} can only be enrolled in a single {policy}.

Within an {agent} {policy} is a set of individual integration policies.
These integration policies define the settings for each input type.
The available settings in an integration relate to the version of
the integration in use; newer functionality can be exposed in this manner over time.

{fleet} uses {agent} policies in two ways:

* Policies are stored in a plain-text YAML file and sent to each {agent} to configure its inputs.
* Policies provide a visual representation of an {agent}s configuration
in the {fleet} UI.

[[policy-benefits]]
== Policy benefits

{agent} policies have many benefits that allow you to:

* Apply a logical grouping of inputs aimed for a particular set of hosts.
* Maintain flexibility in large-scale deployments by quickly testing changes before rolling them out.
* Provide a way to group and manage larger swaths of your infrastructure landscape.

For example, it might make sense to create a {policy} per operating system type:
Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts.
Or, organize policies by functional groupings of how the hosts are
used: IT email servers, Linux servers, user work-stations, etc.
Or perhaps by user categories: engineering department, marketing department, etc.

[[create-a-policy]]
== Create a policy

To manage your {agent}s and the data they collect, create a new policy:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management* > *{fleet}*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-start.png[{fleet} in {kib}]

. In {fleet}, click *Policies* > *Create agent policy*.
Name your policy. All other fields are optional and can be modified later.
By default, each policy enables the _system_ integration, which collects system information and metrics.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-agent-policy.png[{fleet} in {kib}]

. Click *Create agent policy*.

TIP: Consider leaving the `Default` policy unchanged and unused.
It can serve as a useful comparison tool if you run into problems.

[discrete]
[[add-integration]]
== Add an integration to a policy

Policies consist of one or more integrations.
To add a new integration to a policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Policies*.
Click the name of the policy you want to add an integration to.

. Click *Add integration*.

. Search for and select an integration.
Name the integration, and add any required configuration variables.

. Click *Save integration* to save the integration policy as a part of the larger {agent} {policy}.
{fleet} will distribute this new {policy} to all {agent}s that are enrolled with it.

After the {policy} has finished applying, the selected integration will be running on the host
and communicating with the {agent}!

[discrete]
[[apply-a-policy]]
== Apply a policy

NOTE: The first time you use Fleet, you need to set it up.
See the <<fleet-quick-start,Fleet quick start guide>> for more information.

You can apply policies to one or more {agent}s.
To apply a policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Agents*.
Use the check-boxes on the left to select the {agent}s you want to assign to the new policy.
After one or more {agent}s have been selected, click *Assign to new policy* under the bulk action dropdown.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/apply-agent-policy.png[Assign to new policy dropdown]

. Select the {agent} policy from the dropdown list, and click *Assign policy*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/assign-policy.png[Assign policy]

The {agent} status indicator and {agent} logs indicate that the policy is being applied.
It may take a few minutes for the policy change to complete before the {agent} status updates to "Healthy".

[discrete]
[[policy-edit-or-delete]]
== Edit or delete a policy integration

Integrations can easily be reconfigured or deleted.
To edit or delete a policy integration:

. In {fleet}, click *Policies*.
Click on the name of the policy you want to edit or delete.

. Search or scroll to a specific integration.
Open the *Actions* menu and select *Edit integration* or *Delete integration*.
+
Editing or deleting an integration is permanent and cannot be undone.
If you make a mistake, you can always re-configure or re-add an integration.

Any saved changes are immediately distributed and applied to all {agent}s enrolled in the given {policy}.

[discrete]
[[copy-policy]]
== Copy a policy

Policy definitions are stored in a plain-text YAML file that can be downloaded or copied to another policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Policies*.
Click on the name of the policy you want to copy or download.

. To copy a policy, click *Actions* > *Copy policy*.
Name the new policy, and provide a description.
The exact policy definition is copied to the new policy.
+
Alternatively, view and download the policy definition by clicking *Actions* > *View policy*.

[discrete]
[[policy-main-settings]]
== Edit or delete a policy

You can change high-level configurations like a policy's name, description, default namespace,
and agent monitoring status as necessary:

. In {fleet}, click *Policies*.
Click on the name of the policy you want to edit or delete.

. Click the *Settings* tab, make changes, and click *Save changes*
+
Alternatively, click *Delete policy* to delete the policy.
Existing data is not deleted.
Any agents assigned to a policy must be unenrolled or assigned to a different policy before a policy can be deleted.

[discrete]
[[integration-updates]]
== Integration updates

Elastic releases integration updates periodically.
Through the online Elastic Package Registry and the {kib} Elastic Package Manager, Integrations are delivered to the {stack}. When Elastic releases a new Integration, it shows up in the Integrations listing in {kib} after a restart (like during a stack upgrade).
// to do: link to the Fleet API docs
A refresh can also be triggered manually, with the Fleet API.

NOTE: The latest Elastic Package registry version of an integration is the only version
integrated into {agent} policies. Previously installed versions will continue to work.

[discrete]
[[update-an-integration]]
=== Update an integration

. In {fleet}, click *Integrations*.
Search for and select the integration you'd like to update.

. If an update is available, click *Update*.
+
Because updates can change the behavior of hosts,
they must be explicitly requested in the {fleet} app.

. <<create-a-policy,Create a new policy>>.

. <<add-integration,Add the integration to the policy>>.
The newer version is automatically used

. <<apply-a-policy,Apply the policy>> to an {agent}.
+
TIP: In larger deployments, you should test integration updates on a sample {agent}
before rolling out a larger upgrade initiative.
Only after a small trial is deemed successful should the updated policy be
<<roll-out-an-integration,rolled out all hosts>>.

[discrete]
[[roll-out-an-integration]]
=== Roll-out an integration update

After successfully testing an integration update,
it can be safely rolled-out to additional hosts:

. In {fleet}, click *Policies*.
Click on the name of the policy you want to edit or delete.

. Search or scroll to a specific integration.
Open the *Actions* menu and select *Delete integration*.

. Click *Add integration* and re-add the freshly deleted integration.
The updated version will be used and applied to all {agent}s.

. Repeat this process for each policy with the out-of-date integration.

NOTE: In some instances, for example, when there are hundreds or thousands of different {agent}s and
policies that need to be updated, this upgrade path is not feasible.
In this case, update one policy and use the <<copy-policy>> action to apply the updated policy versions to additional policies.
This method's downside is losing
the granularity of assessing the individual Integration version changes individually across policies.
