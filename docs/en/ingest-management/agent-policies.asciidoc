A {policy} is a collection of inputs and settings that defines the data to be collected
by an {agent}. Each {agent} can only be enrolled in a single {policy}.

Within an {agent} {policy} is a set of individual integration policies.
These integration policies define the settings for each input type.
The available settings in an integration depend on the version of
the integration in use.

{fleet} uses {agent} policies in two ways:

* Policies are stored in a plain-text YAML file and sent to each {agent} to configure its inputs.
* Policies provide a visual representation of an {agent}s configuration
in the {fleet} UI.

[[policy-benefits]]
== Policy benefits

{agent} policies have many benefits that allow you to:

* Apply a logical grouping of inputs aimed for a particular set of hosts.
* Maintain flexibility in large-scale deployments by quickly testing changes before rolling them out.
* Provide a way to group and manage larger swaths of your infrastructure landscape.

For example, it might make sense to create a {policy} per operating system type:
Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts.
Or, organize policies by functional groupings of how the hosts are
used: IT email servers, Linux servers, user work-stations, etc.
Or perhaps by user categories: engineering department, marketing department, etc.

[[agent-policy-types]]
== Policy types

In most use cases, {fleet} provides complete central management of {agent}s.
However some use cases, like running in Kubernetes or using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud},
require {agent} infrastructure management outside of {fleet}.
With this in mind, there are two types of {agent} policies:

* **regular policy**: The default use case, where {fleet} provides full central
management for {agent}s. Users can manage {agent} infrastructure by adding,
removing, or upgrading {agent}s. Users can also manage {agent} configuration by updating
the {agent} policy.

* **hosted policy**: A policy where _something else_ provides central management for {agent}s.
For example, in Kubernetes, adding, removing, and upgrading {agent}s should be configured directly in Kubernetes.
Allowing {fleet} users to manage {agent}s would conflict with any Kubernetes configuration.
+
TIP: Hosted policies also apply when using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}.
{ecloud} is responsible for hosting {agent}s and assigning them to a policy.
Platform operators, who create and manage Elastic deployments can add, upgrade,
and remove {agent}s through the {ecloud} console.

Hosted policies display a lock icon in the {fleet} UI, and actions are restricted.
The following table illustrates the {fleet} user actions available to different policy types:

[[create-a-policy]]
== Create a policy

To manage your {agent}s and the data they collect, create a new policy:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management* > *{fleet}*.

. In {fleet}, click *Agent policies* > *Create agent policy*.
Name your policy. All other fields are optional and can be modified later.
By default, each policy enables the _system_ integration, which collects system information and metrics.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-agent-policy.png[{fleet} in {kib}]

. Click *Create agent policy*.

Also see <<create-a-policy-no-ui>>.

[discrete]
[[add-integration]]
== Add an integration to a policy

Policies consist of one or more integrations.
To add a new integration to a policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Agent policies*.
Click the name of the policy you want to add an integration to.

. Click *Add integration*.

. Search for and select an integration.
Name the integration, and add any required configuration variables.

. Click *Save integration* to save the integration policy as a part of the larger {agent} {policy}.
{fleet} will distribute this new {policy} to all {agent}s that are enrolled with it.

After the {policy} has finished applying, the selected integration will be running on the host
and communicating with the {agent}!

[discrete]
[[apply-a-policy]]
== Apply a policy

You can apply policies to one or more {agent}s.
To apply a policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Agents*.

. Select the {agent}s you want to assign to the new policy.
+
After selecting one or more {agent}s, click *Assign to new policy* under the bulk action dropdown.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/apply-agent-policy.png[Assign to new policy dropdown]
+
Unable to select multiple agents? Confirm that your subscription level supports
selective agent policy reassignment in {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{subscriptions}[{stack} subscriptions].

. Select the {agent} policy from the dropdown list, and click *Assign policy*.

The {agent} status indicator and {agent} logs indicate that the policy is being applied.
It may take a few minutes for the policy change to complete before the {agent} status updates to "Healthy".

[discrete]
[[policy-edit-or-delete]]
== Edit or delete an integration policy

Integrations can easily be reconfigured or deleted.
To edit or delete an integration policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Agent policies*.
Click the name of the policy you want to edit or delete.

. Search or scroll to a specific integration.
Open the *Actions* menu and select *Edit integration* or *Delete integration*.
+
Editing or deleting an integration is permanent and cannot be undone.
If you make a mistake, you can always re-configure or re-add an integration.

Any saved changes are immediately distributed and applied to all {agent}s enrolled in the given {policy}.

[discrete]
[[copy-policy]]
== Copy a policy

Policy definitions are stored in a plain-text YAML file that can be downloaded or copied to another policy:

. In {fleet}, click *Agent policies*.
Click the name of the policy you want to copy or download.

. To copy a policy, click *Actions* > *Copy policy*.
Name the new policy, and provide a description.
The exact policy definition is copied to the new policy.
+
Alternatively, view and download the policy definition by clicking *Actions* > *View policy*.

[discrete]
[[policy-main-settings]]
== Edit or delete a policy

You can change high-level configurations like a policy's name, description, default namespace,
and agent monitoring status as necessary:

. In {fleet}, click *Agent policies*.
Click the name of the policy you want to edit or delete.

. Click the *Settings* tab, make changes, and click *Save changes*
+
Alternatively, click *Delete policy* to delete the policy.
Existing data is not deleted.
Any agents assigned to a policy must be unenrolled or assigned to a different policy before a policy can be deleted.

[discrete]
[[change-policy-output]]
== Change the output of a policy

beta[]

Assuming your {subscriptions}[{stack} subscription level] supports per-policy
outputs, you can change the output of a policy to send data to a different
output.

//TODO: Add link to <<output-settings>> after merging
//https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/pull/1807/.

. In {fleet}, click *Settings* and view the list of available outputs.
If necessary, click *Add output* to add a new output with the settings you
require. For more information, refer to <<output-settings>>.

. Click *Agent policies*.
Click the name of the policy you want to change, then click *Settings*.

. Set *Output for integrations* and (optionally) *Output for agent monitoring*
to use a different output, for example, {ls}. You might need to scroll down to
see these options.
+
Unable to select a different output? Confirm that your subscription level
supports per-policy outputs in {fleet}.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/agent-output-settings.png[Screen capture showing the {ls} output policy selected in an agent policy]

. Save your changes.

Any {agent}s enrolled in the agent policy will begin sending data to the
specified outputs.
