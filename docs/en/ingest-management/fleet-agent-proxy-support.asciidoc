= Use a proxy server with {agent} and {fleet}

Your organization’s security strategy and other considerations may require you
to use a proxy server between some components in your deployment. For example,
you may have a firewall rule that prevents endpoints from connecting directly to
{es}. In this scenario, you can set up the {agent} to connect to a proxy, then
the proxy can connect to {es} through the firewall.

Support is available in {agent} and {fleet} for connections through HTTP Connect
(HTTP 1 only) and Socks5 proxy servers.

This guide describes where a proxy server is allowed in your deployment and how
to configure proxy settings for {agent} and {fleet}. The steps for deploying the
proxy server itself are beyond the scope of this article.

NOTE: Some environments require users to authenticate with the proxy. There are
no explicit settings for proxy authentication in {agent} or {fleet}, except the
ability to pass credentials in the URL or as keys/tokens in headers, as
described later.

[[elastic-agent-proxy-config]]
== When to configure proxy settings

Configure proxy settings for {agent} when it must connect through a proxy server
to:

* Download artifacts from `artifacts.elastic.co` for subprocesses or binary
upgrades
* Send data to {es}
* Retrieve agent policies from {fleet-server}
* Retrieve agent policies from {es} (only needed for agents running {fleet-server})

If {fleet} is unable to access the {package-registry} because {kib} is
behind a proxy server, you may also need to set the registry proxy URL
in the {kib} configuration.

[[host-proxy-env-vars]]
== Set default proxy settings in host environment variables

Set environment variables on the host to configure default proxy settings.
The {agent} uses host environment settings by default if no proxy settings are
specified elsewhere. You can override host proxy settings later when you
configure the {agent} and {fleet} settings. The following environment variables
are available on the host:

|===
|Variable |Description

|`HTTP_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTP traffic. 

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTPS traffic.

|`NO_PROXY`
|IP addresses or domain names that should not use the proxy. Supports patterns.
|===

The proxy URL can be a complete URL or `host[:port]`, in which case the `http`
scheme is assumed. An error is returned if the value is a different form.

[[where-to-set-proxy-env-vars]]
=== Where to set proxy environment variables

The location where you set these environment variables is platform-specific and
based on the system manager you're using. Here are some examples to get you
started. For more information about setting environment variables, refer to the
documentation for your operating system.

// lint ignore agent
* For Windows services, set environment variables for the service in
the Windows registry.
+
This PowerShell command sets the
`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Elastic Agent\Environment` registry
key, then restarts {agent}:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$environment = [string[]]@(
  "HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy-hostname:proxy-port",
  "HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy-hostname:proxy-port"
  )

Set-ItemProperty "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Elastic Agent" -Name Environment -Value $environment

Restart-Service "Elastic Agent"
----

* For Linux services, the location depends on the distribution you're using.
For example, you can set environment variables in:

** `/etc/systemd/system/elastic-agent.service` for systems that use `systemd` to
manage the service. To edit the file, run:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl edit --full elastic-agent.service
----
+
Then add the environment variables under `[Service]`
+
[source,shell]
----
[Service]

Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy:8443"
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy:8080"
----

** `/etc/sysconfig/elastic-agent` for Red Hat-like distributions that don't use
`systemd`.

** `/etc/default/elastic-agent` for Debian and Ubuntu distributions that don't
use `systemd`.
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy:8443
HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy:8080
----

After adding environment variables, restart the service.

[[proxy-settings-in-agent-policy]]
== Set {agent} proxy settings in a standalone agent policy

Proxy settings in the {agent} policy override proxy settings specified by
environment variables. This means you can specify proxy settings for {agent}
that are different from host or system-level environment settings. Currently, we only offer a way to modify these for standalone agents. The ability to set these for {fleet}-managed agents is https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/96[under consideration]. 

The following proxy settings are valid in the agent policy:

|===
|Setting | Description

|`proxy_url`
| (string) URL of the proxy server. If set, the configured URL is used as a
proxy for all connection attempts by the component. The value may be either a
complete URL or a `host[:port]`, in which case the `http` scheme is assumed. If
a value is not specified through the configuration, then proxy environment
variables are used. The URL accepts optional `username` and `password` settings
for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`proxy_headers`
| (string) Additional headers to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. You
can use this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the
proxy.

|`proxy_disable`
| (boolean) If set to `true`, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, are ignored.

|===

[discrete]
=== Set the proxy for communicating with {es}

To set the proxy for communicating with {es}, specify proxy settings under
`outputs` in the agent policy. The procedure for doing this depends on
whether you're running {fleet}-managed or standalone agents:

* For {fleet}-managed agents, specify proxy settings in the {kib} UI:
+
--
. In {kib}, open the main menu, then click *Management > {fleet} > Settings*.

. Under *Outputs*, search for the default output, then click the *Edit* icon in
the *Action* column.

. Under *Advanced YAML configuration*, specify proxy settings for
connecting to {es}. For example:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/proxy_url_settings.png[Screen capture of proxy_url setting]
+
The proxy settings you specify here are applied to all {agent}s enrolled in
{fleet}.
--

* For standalone agents, specify proxy settings the `elastic-agent.yml` file. For
example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  default:
    api_key: API-KEY
    hosts:
    - https://10.0.1.2:9200
    proxy_url: http://10.0.1.7:3128
    type: elasticsearch
----
+
For more information, refer to <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.

[[cli-proxy-settings]]
== Set the proxy for retrieving agent policies from {fleet}

If there is a proxy between {agent} and {fleet}, specify proxy settings on the
command line when you install {agent} and enroll in {fleet}. The settings you
specify at the command line are added to the `fleet.yml` file installed on the
system where the {agent} is running.

NOTE: If {kib} is behind a proxy server, you'll still need to
<<epr-proxy-setting,configure {kib} settings>> to access the package registry.

The `enroll` and `install` commands accept the following flags:

|===
| CLI flag | Description

|`--proxy-url <url>`
|URL of the proxy server. The value may be either a complete URL or a
`host[:port]`, in which case the http scheme is assumed.  The URL accepts optional
username and password settings for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`--proxy-disabled`
|If specified, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`
environment variables, are ignored.

|`--proxy-header <header name>=<value>`
|Additional header to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. Use the
`--proxy-header` flag multiple times to add additional headers. You can use
this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the proxy.

|===

For example:

[source,sh]
----
elastic-agent install -f --url="https://10.0.1.6:8220" --enrollment-token=TOKEN --proxy-url="http://10.0.1.7:3128" --fleet-server-es-ca="/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/es-ca.crt" --certificate-authorities="/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/fleet-ca.crt"
----

The command in the previous example adds the following settings to the
`fleet.yml` policy on the host where {agent} is installed:

[source,yaml]
----
fleet:
  enabled: true
  access_api_key: API-KEY
  hosts:
  - https://10.0.1.6:8220
  ssl:
    verification_mode: ""
    certificate_authorities:
    - /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/es-ca.crt
    renegotiation: never
  timeout: 10m0s
  proxy_url: http://10.0.1.7:3128
  reporting:
    threshold: 10000
    check_frequency_sec: 30
  agent:
    id: ""

[[epr-proxy-setting]]
== Set the proxy URL of the {package-registry}

{fleet} might be unable to access the {package-registry} because {kib} is
behind a proxy server.

Also your organization might have network traffic restrictions that prevent {kib}
from reaching the public {package-registry} endpoints, like
https://epr.elastic.co/[epr.elastic.co], to download package metadata and
content. You can route traffic to the public endpoint of EPR through a network
gateway, then configure proxy settings in the
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{kib} configuration file], `kibana.yml`. For
example:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.fleet.registryProxyUrl: your-nat-gateway.corp.net
----
