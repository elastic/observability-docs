= Use a proxy server with {agent} and {fleet}

Your organizationâ€™s security strategy and other considerations may require you
to use a proxy server between some components in your deployment. Support is
available in {agent} and {fleet} for connections through HTTP Connect (HTTP 1
only) and Socks5 proxy servers.

//QUESTION: Do we want to add more context around when users might want to
//use a proxy server? Here's a rough start, but I'm not sure all points are
//relevant or even necessary.

//Proxy servers are often used to provide:

//* Extra layer of security between internal servers and outside traffic
//* User anonymity
//* Single access point for load balancing
//* Access control and audit trail for network devices
//* Traffic compression and file caching

//QUESTION: Do we want to provide a list of popular proxy servers that will work?

This guide describes where a proxy server is allowed in your deployment and how
to configure proxy settings for {agent} and {fleet}. The steps for deploying the
proxy server itself are beyond the scope of this article.

NOTE: Some environments require users to authenticate with the proxy. There are
no explicit settings for proxy authentication in {agent} or {fleet}, except the
ability to pass credentials in the URL or as keys/tokens in headers, as
described later.

== Configure {agent} proxy settings

Configure proxy settings for {agent} when it must connect through a proxy server
to:

* Download artifacts from `artifacts.elastic.co` for subprocesses or binary
upgrades
* Send data to {es}
* Retrieve agent policies from {fleet-server}
* Retrieve agent policies from {es} (when running as a {fleet-server})
* Monitor services (not shown)

image::images/agent-proxy-server.png[Image showing connections between {agent}, {fleet-server}, and {es}]

You can configure {agent} proxy settings in:

* <<host-proxy-env-vars>>
* <<es-output-proxy-settings>>
* <<cli-proxy-settings>>

[discrete]
[[host-proxy-env-vars]]
=== Host environment variables

//QUESTION: Do these only work on Linux and Unix? What about Windows?

Set environment variables on the host to configure default proxy settings.
The {agent} uses host environment settings by default if no proxy settings are
specified elsewhere. You can override host proxy settings later when you
configure the {agent} and {fleet} settings. The following environment variables
are available on the host:

|===
|Variable |Description

|`HTTP_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTP traffic. 

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTPS traffic. `HTTPS_PROXY` takes precedence over
`HTTP_PROXY` for https requests.

|`NO_PROXY`
|IP addresses or domain names that should not use the proxy. Supports patterns.
|===

The proxy URL can be a complete URL or `host[:port]`, in which case the `http`
scheme is assumed. An error is returned if the value is a different form.

Keep in mind that proxy environment settings may affect other components on the
host that send HTTP requests.

[discrete]
[[es-output-proxy-settings]]
=== Proxy settings in the {agent} policy

Configure proxy settings in the {agent} policy to override proxy settings
specified by environment variables. For example, you can configure proxy
settings in the {es} output to override host environment settings.

//QUESTION: Is there a way to set the proxy URL for an input?

The following proxy settings are valid in the {agent} policy:

//QUESTION: Where are these proxy settings valid for Elastic Agent? Just under
//output? What about input (for services behind a proxy)? I'm not sure how you
//would configure that if you're not using standalone.

|===
|Setting | Description

|`proxy_url`
| (string) URL of the proxy server. If set, the configured URL is used as a
proxy for all connection attempts by the component. The value may be either a
complete URL or a `host[:port]`, in which case the `http` scheme is assumed. If
a value is not specified through the configuration, then proxy environment
variables are used. The URL accepts optional `username` and `password` settings
for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`proxy_headers`
| (string) Additional headers to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. You
can use this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the
proxy.

|`proxy_disable`
| (boolean) If set to `true`, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, are ignored.

|===

For {fleet}-managed agents, specify proxy settings in the {kib} UI:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.

. Click *{fleet} settings*.

. Under *Elasticsearch output configuration (YAML)*, specify proxy settings for
connecting to {es}. The proxy settings you specify here are applied to all
{agent}s enrolled in {fleet}.
+
ADD SCREEN CAPTURE. NEED A REALISTIC EXAMPLE TO PROVIDE HERE.

For standalone agents, specify proxy settings the `elastic-agent.yml` file. For
example:

[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'http://localhost:9200'
    proxy_url: 'https://192.0.2.0:8080'
----

//QUESTION: What should this config actually look like ^^.

For more information, refer to <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.

[discrete]
[[cli-proxy-settings]]
=== Command-line flags when enrolling in {fleet}

//QUESTION: It sounds like the user need to visit Fleet to load policies before
//running the command? Or can we just assume users will do that first before
//getting to this step?

Specify proxy settings on the command line when you are enrolling in {fleet} and
the proxy configuration is not yet available. During enrollment, the proxy
settings specified at the command line are copied to internal configuration
files.

//QUESTION: What does it mean for these settings to be copied to the internal
//config? Will they be persisted and used after enrollment?

The `enroll` and `install` commands accept the following flags:

|===
| CLI flag | Description

|`--proxy-url <url>`
|URL of the proxy server. The value may be either a complete URL or a
`host[:port]`, in which case the http scheme is assumed.  The URL accepts optional
username and password settings for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`--proxy-disabled`
|If specified, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`
environment variables, are ignored.

|`--proxy-header <header name>=<value>`
|Additional header to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. Use the
`--proxy-header` flag multiple times to add additional headers. You can use
this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the proxy.

== Configure {fleet} proxy settings

Configure proxy settings for {fleet} when it must connect through a proxy server
to:

* Access the Elastic Package Registry
* Communicate with {es}

image::images/fleet-proxy-server.png[Image showing connections between {fleet}, {es}, and the Elastic Package Registry]

TIP: If you're using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}, you don't have to configure
{fleet} proxy settings because they are handled by {ecloud}.

[discrete]
[[epr-proxy-setting]]
=== Access the Elastic Package Registry through a proxy

{fleet} might be unable to access the Elastic Package Registry because {kib} is
behind a proxy server.

Also your organization might have network traffic restrictions that prevent {kib}
from reaching the public Elastic Package Registry endpoints, like
https://epr.elastic.co/[epr.elastic.co], to download package metadata and
content. You can route traffic to the public endpoint of EPR through a network
gateway, then configure proxy settings in the {kib} configuration file,
`kibana.yml`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.fleet.registryProxyUrl: your-nat-gateway.corp.net
----

[discrete]
[[es-proxy-setting]]
=== Access {es} through a proxy

When {fleet} is behind a proxy server, configure {fleet} settings to
specify the URL for the proxy server:

//QUESTION: Is correct? There does not appear to be a Proxy URL setting under
//Fleet settings. Can you provide a screen captures showing realistic values?

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.

. Click *{fleet} Settings*.

. Add the proxy URL to the following fields:
+
--
* *{es} hosts*

* *{fleet-server} hosts*
--
+
NEED A SCREEN SHOWING VALID SETTINGS IN THIS DIALOG.


//QUESTION: Unrelated to this section, but do we need to say anything about
//certs here?
