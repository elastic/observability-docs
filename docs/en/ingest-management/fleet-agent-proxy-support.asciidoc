= Use a proxy server with {agent} and {fleet}

Your organizationâ€™s security strategy and other considerations may require you
to use a proxy server between some components in your deployment. For example,
you may have a firewall rule that prevents endpoints from connecting directly to
{es}. In this scenario, you can set up the {agent} to connect to a proxy, then
the proxy can connect to {es} through the firewall.

Support is available in {agent} and {fleet} for connections through HTTP Connect
(HTTP 1 only) and Socks5 proxy servers.

This guide describes where a proxy server is allowed in your deployment and how
to configure proxy settings for {agent} and {fleet}. The steps for deploying the
proxy server itself are beyond the scope of this article.

NOTE: Some environments require users to authenticate with the proxy. There are
no explicit settings for proxy authentication in {agent} or {fleet}, except the
ability to pass credentials in the URL or as keys/tokens in headers, as
described later.

[[elastic-agent-proxy-config]]
== Configure {agent} proxy settings

Configure proxy settings for {agent} when it must connect through a proxy server
to:

* Download artifacts from `artifacts.elastic.co` for subprocesses or binary
upgrades
* Send data to {es}
* Retrieve agent policies from {fleet-server}
* Retrieve agent policies from {es} (only needed for agents running {fleet-server})
* Monitor services (not shown)

image::images/agent-proxy-server.png[Image showing connections between {agent}, {fleet-server}, and {es}]

You can configure {agent} proxy settings by specifying:

* <<host-proxy-env-vars>>
* <<proxy-settings-in-agent-policy>>
* <<cli-proxy-settings>>

[discrete]
[[host-proxy-env-vars]]
=== Host environment variables

Set environment variables on the host to configure default proxy settings.
The {agent} uses host environment settings by default if no proxy settings are
specified elsewhere. You can override host proxy settings later when you
configure the {agent} and {fleet} settings. The following environment variables
are available on the host:

|===
|Variable |Description

|`HTTP_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTP traffic. 

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTPS traffic.

|`NO_PROXY`
|IP addresses or domain names that should not use the proxy. Supports patterns.
|===

The proxy URL can be a complete URL or `host[:port]`, in which case the `http`
scheme is assumed. An error is returned if the value is a different form.

Keep in mind that proxy environment settings may affect other components on the
host that send HTTP requests.

//TODO: Add examples of how/where to set env vars on various platforms.

[[proxy-settings-in-agent-policy]]
=== Proxy settings in the {agent} policy

Proxy settings in the {agent} policy override proxy settings specified by
environment variables. The following proxy settings are valid in the agent
policy:

|===
|Setting | Description

|`proxy_url`
| (string) URL of the proxy server. If set, the configured URL is used as a
proxy for all connection attempts by the component. The value may be either a
complete URL or a `host[:port]`, in which case the `http` scheme is assumed. If
a value is not specified through the configuration, then proxy environment
variables are used. The URL accepts optional `username` and `password` settings
for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`proxy_headers`
| (string) Additional headers to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. You
can use this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the
proxy.

|`proxy_disable`
| (boolean) If set to `true`, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, are ignored.

|===

Proxy settings are valid in the {agent} policy under the following sections:

* `outputs` - set the proxy server for communicating with {es}.

* `fleet` - set the proxy server for retrieving agent policies from
{fleet}.

* `agent.download` - set the proxy server for retrieving artifacts or binary
upgrades from `artifacts.elastic.co`.

//TODO: Clarify where to add these settings ^^. For Fleet-managed agents, it
//sounds like you need to set these in both the UI and fleet.yml, but it seems
//odd to ask users to configure a file on the host when the policy is managed
//by Fleet. 

For {fleet}-managed agents, specify proxy settings in the {kib} UI:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.

. Click *{fleet} settings*.

. Under *Elasticsearch output configuration (YAML)*, specify proxy settings for
connecting to {es}. The proxy settings you specify here are applied to all
{agent}s enrolled in {fleet}.
+
//TODO: Add a realistic example here.

For standalone agents, specify proxy settings the `elastic-agent.yml` file. For
example:

[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'http://localhost:9200'
    proxy_url: 'https://192.0.2.0:8080'
----

For more information, refer to <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.

[[cli-proxy-settings]]
=== Command-line flags when enrolling in {fleet}

Specify proxy settings on the command line if you are enrolling in {fleet} and
the proxy configuration is not yet available. These settings are added to the
`fleet.yml` file; you'll still need to
<<fleet-proxy-configuration,configure {fleet} proxy settings>> for {fleet} to
access the package registry and to communicate with {es}.

The `enroll` and `install` commands accept the following flags:

|===
| CLI flag | Description

|`--proxy-url <url>`
|URL of the proxy server. The value may be either a complete URL or a
`host[:port]`, in which case the http scheme is assumed.  The URL accepts optional
username and password settings for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`--proxy-disabled`
|If specified, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`
environment variables, are ignored.

|`--proxy-header <header name>=<value>`
|Additional header to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. Use the
`--proxy-header` flag multiple times to add additional headers. You can use
this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the proxy.

|===

For example:

[source,sh]
----
//TODO: Add an example here
----

NOTE: These commands require default policies to be loaded in {fleet}. Default
policies are loaded automatically when you visit {fleet} for the first time. If
you're not sure whether default policies are loaded, log in to {kib} and go to
*Management > {fleet}*.

[discrete]
[[fleet-proxy-configuration]]
== Configure {fleet} proxy settings

Configure proxy settings for {fleet} when it must connect through a proxy server
to:

* Access the Elastic Package Registry
* Communicate with {es}

image::images/fleet-proxy-server.png[Image showing connections between {fleet}, {es}, and the Elastic Package Registry]

TIP: If you're using our hosted {ess} on {ecloud}, you don't have to configure
{fleet} proxy settings because they are handled by {ecloud}.

[discrete]
[[epr-proxy-setting]]
=== Access the Elastic Package Registry through a proxy

{fleet} might be unable to access the Elastic Package Registry because {kib} is
behind a proxy server.

Also your organization might have network traffic restrictions that prevent {kib}
from reaching the public Elastic Package Registry endpoints, like
https://epr.elastic.co/[epr.elastic.co], to download package metadata and
content. You can route traffic to the public endpoint of EPR through a network
gateway, then configure proxy settings in the {kib} configuration file,
`kibana.yml`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.fleet.registryProxyUrl: your-nat-gateway.corp.net
----

[discrete]
[[es-proxy-setting]]
=== Access {es} through a proxy

When {fleet} is behind a proxy server, configure {fleet} settings to
specify the URL for the proxy server:

//QUESTION: Is correct? There does not appear to be a Proxy URL setting under
//Fleet settings. Can you provide a screen captures showing realistic values?

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.

. Click *{fleet} Settings*.

. Add the proxy URL to the following fields:
+
--
* *{es} hosts*

* *{fleet-server} hosts*
--
+
//TODO: Add screen capture that shows valid settings in this dialog.


//QUESTION: Unrelated to this section, but do we need to say anything about
//certs here?
