[[fleet-enrollment-tokens]]
= {fleet} enrollment tokens

A {fleet} enrollment token is an {es} API key that you use to enroll one or more
{agent}s in {fleet}. The enrollment token enrolls the {agent} in a specific
agent policy that defines the data to be collected by the agent. You can
use the token as many times as required. It will remain valid until you revoke
it.

The enrollment token is used for the initial communication between {agent} and
{fleet-server}. After the initial connection request from the {agent},
the {fleet-server} passes two API keys to the {agent}:

* An output API key
+
This API key is used to send data to {es}. It has the minimal permissions needed
to ingest all the data specified by the agent policy. If the API key is invalid,
the {agent} stops ingesting data into {es}.

* A communication API key
+
This API key is used to communicate with the {fleet-server}. It has only the
permissions needed to communicate with the {fleet-server}. If the API key is
invalid, {fleet-server} stops communicating with the {agent}.
