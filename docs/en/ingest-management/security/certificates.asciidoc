= Configure SSL/TLS for self-managed {fleet-server}s

If you're running a self-managed cluster, configure Transport Layer Security
(TLS) to encrypt traffic between {agent}s, {fleet-server}, and other components
in the {stack}.

TIP: Our {ess-product}[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud} provides secure, encrypted
connections out of the box!

[discrete]
[[prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

Configure security and generate certificates for the {stack}. For more
information about securing the {stack}, refer to
{ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[Configure security for the {stack}].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{agent}s require a PEM-formatted CA certificate to send encrypted data to {es}.
If you followed the steps in {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[Configure
security for the {stack}], your certificate will be in a p12 file. To convert
it, use openssl:

[source,shell]
----
openssl pkcs12 -in path.p12 -out cert.crt -clcerts -nokeys
openssl pkcs12 -in path.p12 -out private.key -nocerts -nodes
----

Key passwords are not currently supported.

[[generate-fleet-server-certs]]
== Generate a custom certificate and private key for {fleet-server}

This section describes how to use the `certutil` tool provided by {es}, but you
can use whatever process you typically use to generate PEM-formatted
certificates.

. Generate a certificate authority (CA). Skip this step if you want to use an
existing CA.
+
--
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca --pem
----

This command creates a zip file that contains the CA certificate and key you'll
use to sign the {fleet-server} certificate. Extract the zip file:

image::images/ca.png[Screen capture of a folder called ca that contains two files: ca.crt and ca.key]

Store the files in a secure location.
--

. Use the certificate authority to generate certificates for {fleet-server}.
For example:
+
--
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert \
  --name fleet-server \
  --ca-cert /path/to/ca/ca.crt \
  --ca-key /path/to/ca/ca.key \
  --dns your.host.name.here \
  --ip 192.0.2.1 \
  --pem
----

Where `dns` and `ip` specify the name and IP address of the {fleet-server}. Run
this command for each {fleet-server} you plan to deploy.

This command creates a zip file that includes a `.crt` and `.key`
file. Extract the zip file:

image::images/fleet-server-certs.png[Screen capture of a folder called fleet-server that contains two files: fleet-server.crt and fleet-server.key]

Store the files in a secure location. You'll need these files later to encrypt
traffic between {agent}s and {fleet-server}.

== Encrypt traffic between {agent}s, {fleet-server}, and {es}

{fleet-server} needs a CA certificate or the CA fingerprint to connect securely to {es}. It also
needs to expose a {fleet-server} certificate so other {agent}s can connect to it
securely.

For the steps in this section, imagine you have the following files:

[cols=2*]
|===

|`ca.crt`
|The CA certificate to use to connect to {fleet-server}. This is the
CA used to <<generate-fleet-server-certs,generate a certificate and key>>
for {fleet-server}.

|`fleet-server.crt`
|The certificate you generated for {fleet-server}.

|`fleet-server.key`
|The private key you generated for {fleet-server}.

|`elasticsearch-ca.crt`
|The CA certificate to use to connect to {es}. This is the CA used to generate
certs for {es} (see <<prereqs>>).

Note that the CA certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint (hash) may be used instead of the `elasticsearch-ca.crt` file for securing connections to {es}.


|===

To encrypt traffic between {agent}s, {fleet-server}, and {es}:

. Configure {fleet} settings. These settings are applied to all {fleet}-managed
{agent}s.

. In {kib}, open the main menu, then click *Management > {fleet} > Settings*.

.. Under *{fleet-server} hosts*, specify the URLs {agent}s will use to connect to
{fleet-server}. For example, https://192.0.2.1:8220, where 192.0.2.1 is the host
IP where you will install {fleet-server}.
+
TIP: For host settings, use the `https` protocol. DNS-based names are also
allowed.

.. Under *Outputs*, search for the default output, then click the *Edit* icon in
the *Action* column.

.. In the *Hosts* field, specify the {es} URLs where
{agent}s will send data. For example, https://192.0.2.0:9200.

.. Specify either a CA certificate or CA fingerprint to connect securely
{es}:

// lint ignore elasticsearch
* If you have a CA trusted fingerprint, specify it in the
*Elasticsearch CA trusted fingerprint* field. To learn more, refer to the
{ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[{es} security documentation].

* Otherwise, under *Advanced YAML configuration*, set
`ssl.certificate_authorities` and specify the CA certificate to use to connect
to {es}. You can specify a list of file paths (if the files are available), or
embed a certificate directly in the YAML configuration. If you specify file
paths, the certificates must be available on the hosts running the {agent}s.
+
File path example:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/path/to/your/elasticsearch-ca.crt"] <1>
----
<1> The path to the CA certificate on the {agent} host.

. Install an {agent} as a {fleet-server} on the host and configure it to use TLS:

.. If you don't already have a {fleet-server} service token, click the *Agents*
tab in {fleet} and follow the instructions to generate the service token now.
+
TIP: The in-product installation steps are incomplete. Before running the
`install` command, add the settings shown in the next step.

.. From the directory where you extracted {fleet-server}, run the `install`
command and specify the certificates to use.
+
--
The following command installs {agent} as a service, enrolls it in the
{fleet-server} policy, and starts the service.

NOTE: If you're using DEB or RPM, or already have the {agent} installed, use the
`enroll` command along with the following options, then start the service as
described in <<start-elastic-agent-service>>.

[source,shell]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install -f \
   --url=https://192.0.2.1:8220 \
   --fleet-server-es=https://192.0.2.0:9200 \
   --fleet-server-service-token=AAEBAWVsYXm0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2XydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2MjM4OTAztDU1OTQ6dllfVW1mYnFTVjJwTC2ZQ0EtVnVZQQ \

   --certificate-authorities=/path/to/ca.crt \
   --fleet-server-cert=/path/to/fleet-server.crt \
   --fleet-server-cert-key=/path/to/fleet-server.key
----

Where:

`url`::
{fleet-server} URL.
`fleet-server-es`::
{es} URL
`fleet-server-service-token`::
Service token to use to communicate with {es}.
`fleet-server-es-ca`::
CA certificate to use to connect to {es}.
`certificate-authorities`::
CA certificate to use to connect to {fleet-server}.
`fleet-server-cert`::
Certificate to use for the exposed {fleet-server} HTTPS endpoint.
`fleet-server-cert-key`::
Private key to use for the exposed {fleet-server} HTTPS endpoint.

.What happens if you enroll {fleet-server} without specifying certificates?
****

If the certificates are managed by your organization and installed at the system
level, they will be used to encrypt traffic between {agent}s, {fleet-server},
and {es}.

If system-level certificates don't exist, {fleet-server} automatically generates
self-signed certificates. Traffic between {fleet-server} and {agent}s over
HTTPS is encrypted, but the certificate chain cannot be verified. Any {agent}s
enrolling in {fleet-server} will need to pass the `--insecure` flag to
acknowledge that the certificate chain is not verified.

Allowing {fleet-server} to generate self-signed certificates is useful to get
things running for development, but not recommended in a production environment.
****
--

. Install your {agent}s and enroll them in {fleet}.
+
--
{agent}s connecting to a secured {fleet-server} need to pass in the CA
certificate used by the {fleet-server}. The CA certificate used by {es} is
already specified in the agent policy because it's set under {fleet} settings in
{kib}. You do not need to pass it on the command line.

The following command installs {agent} as a service, enrolls it
in the agent policy associated with the specified token, and starts the service.

[source,shell]
----
sudo elastic-agent install -f --url=https://192.0.2.1:8220 \
  --enrollment-token=<string> \
  --certificate-authorities=/path/to/ca.crt
----

Where:

`url`::
{fleet-server} URL to use to enroll the {agent} into {fleet}.
`enrollment-token`::
The enrollment token for the policy that will be applied to the {agent}.
`certificate-authorities`::
CA certificate to use to connect to {fleet-server}. This is the
CA used to <<generate-fleet-server-certs,generate a certificate and key>>
for {fleet-server}.

// lint ignore elastic-agent
Don't have an enrollment token? On the *Agents* tab in {fleet}, click *Add agent*.
Under *Enroll and start the Elastic Agent*, follow the in-product installation steps, making sure
that you add the `--certificate-authorities` option before you run the command.
