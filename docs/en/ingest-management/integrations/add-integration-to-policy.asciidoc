Policies consist of one or more integrations. To add a new integration to a
policy:

. In {kib}, go to **Management > Integrations**.
+
Notice that the Integrations page shows {agent} integrations along with other
types, such as {beats}.
// lint ignore elastic-agent
. Scroll down and select **Elastic Agent only** so the view shows
integrations that work with {agent}.

. Search for and select an integration.
. Click **Add <Integration>**.
. Name the integration and add any required configuration variables.
+
NOTE: Integration policy names must be globally unique across all agent
policies.

. Choose the agent policy you want to add the integration to. You can choose an
existing agent policy or create a new one.
. Click **Save integration**. This action installs the integration (if it's not
already installed) and saves the integration policy as a part of the
larger {agent} {policy}. {fleet} distributes this new policy to all {agent}s
that are enrolled in the agent policy.

If you haven't deployed any {agent}s yet or set up agent policies, start with
one of our quick start guides:

* {observability-guide}/ingest-traces.html[Ingest application traces with {agent}]
