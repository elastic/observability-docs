[[add-integration-to-policy]]
= Add an {agent} integration to a policy

Policies consist of one or more integrations. To add a new integration to a
policy:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations*.
+
Notice that the Integrations page shows {agent} integrations along with other
types, such as {beats}.

// lint ignore elastic-agent
. Scroll down and select *Elastic Agent only* so the view shows
integrations that work with {agent}.

. Search for and select an integration.

. Click *Add <Integration>*.

. Name the integration, and add any required configuration variables.

. Choose the policy you want to add the integration to. You can choose an
existing policy or create a new one.

. Click *Save integration* to save the integration policy as a part of the
larger {agent} {policy}. {fleet} will distribute this new policy to all {agent}s
that are enrolled with it.

If you haven't deployed any {agent}s yet or set up agent policies, start with
one of our quick start guides:
