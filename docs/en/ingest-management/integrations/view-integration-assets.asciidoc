= View {agent} integration assets

{agent} integrations come with a number of assets, such as dashboards, saved
searches, and visualizations for analyzing data.

To view integration assets:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations > Installed*. Search for and select
the integration you want to view.

. Click the *Assets* tab to see a list of assets. If this tab does not exist,
the assets are not installed. 

If {agent} is already streaming data to {es}, you can follow the links to
view the assets in {kib}.
