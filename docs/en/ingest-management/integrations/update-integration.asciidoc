= Update an integration

IMPORTANT: An internet connection is required for {kib} to download integration
packages from the Elastic Package Registry. Make sure the {kib} server can
connect to `https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`.

Elastic releases integration updates periodically. To use new features and
capabilities, you need to update the integration to the latest version and
optionally upgrade integration policies to use the new version.

TIP: In larger deployments, you should test integration updates on a sample
{agent} before rolling out a larger upgrade initiative.

To update an integration to the latest version:

. In {kib}, go to *Management > Integrations > Manage*. Search for and select
the integration you want to update. Notice there is a warning icon next to the
version number to indicate an update is available.

. Click the *Settings* tab, then click *Update to latest version*.
+
Because updates can change the behavior of hosts, updates must be explicitly
requested in the *Integrations* app.

. After the update is complete, verify that the installed version and latest
version match.

Integration policies created before the update will use the older package
version and continue to work. To use the latest version, you need to
upgrade the  policy:

. Click the *Policies* tab and find the integration policies you want to
update.

. Click *Upgrade* to begin the upgrade process.

. Make any required configuration changes and review the changes before clicking
*Save*.

. Repeat this process for each policy with the out-of-date integration.
