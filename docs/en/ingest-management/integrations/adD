?.Search for and, select an integration.
Click Add <Integration>*.

. Name the integration, and add any required configuration variables.

. Choose the policy you want to add the integration to. You can choose an
existing policy or create a new one.

. Click *Save integration* to save the integration policy as a part of the
larger {agent} {policy}. {fleet} will distribute this new policy to all {agent}s
that are enrolled with it.

If you haven't deployed any {agent}s yet or set up agent policies, start with
one of our quick start guides:
