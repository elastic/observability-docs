beta[]

This guide describes how to:

* Collect logs and metrics from systems and services across your organization
* Send the data to the {stack}
* Explore and visualize the data in real-time

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {im-forum}[discuss forum].

[[fleet-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

Before you begin, please read <<fleet-limitations>>.

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud} (recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.

Here's what you need for each deployment type:

[[install-integration]]
== Step 1: Add integrations

{fleet} provides _integrations_ that bundle various assets needed to
ingest and visualize data.

In this guide, we assume that you have `nginx` running on some of your
infrastructure, and want to collect logs and metrics from it. To do so:

. Log in to {kib} and go to **Management > {fleet}**.
+

image::images/kibana-fleet-start.png[{fleet} in {kib}]

. In {fleet}, click the **Integrations** tab and use the search bar to
find the Nginx integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]

. Click the Nginx integration to see more details about it, and then click
**Add Nginx**.
+
[role="screenshot"]

. On the **Add Nginx integration** page, select the default agent policy,
then scroll down to inspect or change the default settings.
+
[role="screenshot"]

. If your logs are not in the default location, click the down arrow next to
enabled streams and change the **Paths** field. 

. When you're done, click **Save integration**. 
+
The newly added Nginx integration should appear under **Integrations** in the
Default policy. Note that the `system-1` integration has been created by
default.

[[install-run-elastic-agent]]
== Step 3: Install and run {agent}

include::{beats-repo-dir}/x-pack/elastic-agent/docs/install-elastic-agent.asciidoc[tag=install-elastic-agent]

See the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[download page] for other
installation options.

After the download is complete, decide which mode you want to run in: {fleet}
or standalone. What's the difference?

* With <<agent-fleet-mode,_{fleet} mode_>>, you use {fleet} in {kib} to
define and manage {agent} policies from a central location.
* With <<agent-standalone-mode,_standalone mode_>>, you configure {agent}
manually on the system where the agent is installed.

[discrete]
[[agent-fleet-mode]]
=== {fleet} mode

To use {fleet} to configure {agent}:

. In {fleet}, click **Settings** and change the defaults, if necessary.
For self-managed installations, set the URLs for {es} and {kib}, including
the http ports, then save your changes.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-settings.png[{fleet} settings]

. Enable central management. Click the **Agents** tab and click
**Create user and enable central management**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-enable.png[{fleet} showing prompt to enable central management]

. On the **Agents** tab, click **Add agent** and complete the steps under
**Enroll in {fleet}**. Skip the first step because you downloaded {agent}
earlier.

. Choose an agent policy (or accept the default).

. Copy the command for enrolling and starting the agent.
+
The copied command contains your {kib} URL and an enrollment key that was
generated by {fleet}.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-enroll.png[{fleet} showing agent enrollment page]

. In the directory where {agent} is installed, run the command you copied. Note
that this command will overwrite the `elastic-agent.yml` file in that directory.
+

. In {fleet}, click **Continue** to go to the **Agents**
tab, where you should see the newly enrolled agent.

If you run into problems, see <<ingest-management-troubleshooting>>.

TIP: To unenroll an agent, see <<unenroll-elastic-agent>>.

[[agent-standalone-mode]]
=== Standalone mode (manual configuration)

To configure {agent} manually:

. On the **{fleet}** tab, click **Add agent** and complete the steps under
**Standalone mode**. Skip the first step because you downloaded {agent}
earlier.

. Select an agent policy (or accept the default).

. Copy the content of the agent policy and put it into a file named
`elastic-agent.yml` on the system where {agent} is installed.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-yaml.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy in YAML format]
+
NOTE: The policy generated by {fleet} already contains the correct {es} address
and port for your setup. If you run everything locally, the address is
`127.0.0.1:9200`. If you use our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}] on {ecloud},
the address corresponds to the {es} endpoint URL that is listed under
**Endpoints** as described in {cloud}/ec-working-with-elasticsearch.html[Work
with {es}].

. Change the {es} username and password in the `outputs` section of the
policy file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
[...]
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'HOST:PORT'
    username: ES_USERNAME
    password: ES_PASSWORD
datasources:
[...]
----


. Run {agent}:

[[view-data]]
== Step 4: View your data

In {fleet}, click the **Data streams** tab to inspect the data
that is sent by {agent}. From the **Actions** column, you can navigate to the
dashboards corresponding to the data type that is sent.

metrics, uptime, and application performance data by using
