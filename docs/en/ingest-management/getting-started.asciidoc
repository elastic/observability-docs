= Quick start: Get logs and metrics into the {stack}

beta[]

This guide describes how to:

* Collect logs and metrics from systems and services across your organization
* Send the data to the {stack}
* Explore and visualize the data in real-time

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the {forum}[discuss forum].

[[fleet-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

* Please read <<fleet-limitations>>.

* You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and
managing it. You can use our
{ess-product}[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud} (recommended), or self-manage the {stack} on your own hardware.
+
Here's what you need for each deployment type:

[[set-up-fleet]]
== Step 1: Set up {fleet}

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get logs, metrics, and security data into the {stack}.

TIP: Not using {fleet}? Advanced users who want to configure and manage
{agent}s manually can <<run-elastic-agent-standalone,run agents standalone>>.

The first time you use {fleet}, you might need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{tab-widgets}/add-fleet-server/widget.asciidoc[]

For more information, see <<fleet-server>>.

[[add-agent-to-fleet]]
== Step 2: Add an {agent} to {fleet}

include::elastic-agent/elastic-agent.asciidoc[tag=agent-install-intro]

To send logs and metrics to the {stack}:

. On the **Agents** tab in {fleet}, click **Add agent**.

. Under **Enroll in {fleet}**, follow the in-product installation steps.

+
See the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent[download page] for other
installation options.

*Notes:*


* Use the default agent policy to get started quickly. This policy includes a
system integration for collecting logs and metrics from the host system. You
can change the policy later.

* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service, enrolls it
in the selected policy, and starts the service. For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
./elastic-agent install -f --url=https://10.0.2.2:8220 \
--enrollment-token=blJqaUdua0JqYXA0bmNscVVjUkE6ZGh4WWNRSHRRek9aSS1paEs2cHdFQQ==
----
+
* Because {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will restart
automatically if the system is rebooted. 

* To see where files are installed, see <<installation-layout>>. 

If installation is successful, you’ll see the agent on the *Agents*
tab in *Fleet*. Notice that the Default policy is assigned to the
agent.

TIP: If the status hangs at Enrolling, make sure the `elastic-agent` process
is running.

If you run into problems, see <<fleet-troubleshooting>>.

[[view-data]]
== Step 3: Monitor host logs and metrics

Next, view the data sent by {agent}. Right now, {agent} is only sending data
about the host system because you haven't configured the agent to collect data
from other sources yet.

To see host logs and metrics:

. In {fleet}, click the **Data streams** tab.
. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
to the data stream. For example, to see host metrics, select one of the system
datasets:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-datastreams.png[{fleet} showing data streams list]
+
Then navigate to the [Metrics System] Host overview dashboard:

[[add-nginx-integration]]
== Step 4: Monitor Nginx logs and metrics
[discrete]

Next, you'll browse a catalog of integrations, then add an Nginx integration to
the default policy used by your agent. You use policies to manage settings
across a group of agents. An agent policy may contain any number of integrations
for collecting observability data from the various services running on your
host.

NOTE: For these steps, we assume that you have `nginx` running on some of your
infrastructure, and want to collect logs and metrics from it.

. In {kib}, go back to **Management > {fleet}**, and click the **Integrations**
tab. Use the search bar to find the Nginx integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-nginx.png[{fleet} showing Nginx integration]
. Click the Nginx integration to see more details about it, then click
**Add Nginx**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-integrations-nginx-overview.png[{fleet} showing Nginx integration overview]

. On the **Add Nginx integration** page, select the default policy.
+
In this guide, you add integrations to the default policy created by
{kib}. After you learn the basics, you can create your own policies and assign
them to agents.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-integration.png[{fleet} Add Nginx integration page]

. Under **Configure integration**, click the down arrow next to enabled streams
and make sure the **Paths** are correct for your host. Inspect or change other
settings

. When you're done, save and deploy the changes.

. To see the updated policy, click the *Policies* tab, then click the
*Default policy* link.
+
The newly added Nginx integration should appear under **Integrations** in the
default policy, along with the `system-1` integration.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-nginx.png[{fleet} showing default agent policy with nginx-1 datasource]
+
All {agent}s that use this policy will collect logs and metrics from the
Nginx server and the host.

. To view the data, click the **Data streams** tab.

. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
to the data stream.

//TODO: Add dashboard.

== What's next?

* Now that data is streaming into the {stack}, take your investigation to a
deeper level! Use https://www.elastic.co/observability[Elastic {observability}]
to unify your logs, metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
https://www.elastic.co/security[{elastic-sec}]. Adding endpoint protection is
just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
{observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Create alerts] and find out about
problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use machine learning to
{observability-guide}/inspect-log-anomalies.html[detect anomalies].

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
other hosts by deploying {agent}s across your infrastructure!
