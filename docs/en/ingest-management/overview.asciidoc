[[elastic-agent]]
== {agent}

//TODO: We need to converge on a single definition for this product because
//we describe it in many different ways in these docs and others. I've made
//some minor edits to this description, but it still needs work.

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy
monitoring across your infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy you
can update to add integrations for new data sources.

For more information, refer to <<elastic-agent-installation>>.

[[unified-integrations]]
== {integrations}

Our integrations provide an easy way to add new sources of data, plus they ship
with out-of-the-box assets like dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines to
extract structured fields out of logs. This makes it easier to get insights
within seconds. Integrations are available for popular services and platforms
like Nginx or AWS, as well as many generic input types like log files. 

{kib} provides a web-based UI to add and manage integrations. You can browse a
unified view of available integrations that shows both {agent} and {beats}
integrations.

For a list of {agent} integrations, refer to
{integrations-docs}[{agent} Integrations]. To explore {beats} integrations,
refer to {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules-overview.html[Filebeat modules] for
logs or {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-modules.html[Metricbeat modules] for
metrics.

[discrete]
[[configuring-integrations]]
== {agent} policies

Each {agent} is enrolled in an {agent} policy that allows you to use any number
of integrations for data sources. You can apply the {agent} policy to multiple
agents, making it even easier to manage configuration at scale.

When you add an integration, you select the agent policy to use then
configure inputs for logs and metrics, such as the path to your Nginx access
logs. When you're done, you save the integration to update the {agent}
policy. The next time enrolled agents check in, they receive the update.
Having the policies automatically deployed is more convenient
than doing it yourself by using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or some other tool.

For more information, refer to <<integrations>>.

If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may use YAML files and APIs.
{fleet} has an API-first design. Anything you can do in the UI, you
can also do using the {fleet-guide}/fleet-api-docs.html[`API`].
This makes it easy to automate and integrate with other systems.

[discrete]
[[package-registry-intro]]
== {package-registry}

The {package-registry} is an online package hosting service for the {agent}
integrations available in {kib}.

{kib} connects to the {package-registry} at `epr.elastic.co` using the Elastic
Package Manager, downloads the latest integration package, and stores its assets
in {es}. This process typically requires an internet connection because
integrations are updated and released periodically. In air-gapped environments,
you can host your own {package-registry}.

If you are running a self-managed deployment, you may need to configure the
outbound connection so that the Elastic Package Manager can reach the
{package-registry}.

To do so, add the following setting to your `kibana.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.fleet.registryProxyUrl: <your-proxy-address>
----

You can find more information about running the {package-registry} in air-gapped
environments in the section about {fleet-guide}/air-gapped.html[Air-gapped environments].

[discrete]
[[central-management]]
== Central management in {fleet}

{fleet} provides a web-based UI in {kib} for centrally managing {agent}s and
their policies.

You can see the state of all your {agent}s in {fleet}. On the **Agents** page,
you can see which agents are online, which have errors, and the last time
they checked in. You can also see the version of the {agent} binary and
policy.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-agents-overview.png[Agents page]

{fleet} serves as the communication channel back to the {agent}s. Agents check
in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of agents
enrolled into each agent policy, which allows you to scale up to
thousands of hosts.

When you make a change to an agent policy, all the agents receive the update
during their next check-in. You no longer have to distribute policy updates
yourself.

When you're ready to upgrade your {agent} binaries or integrations, you can
initiate upgrades in {fleet}, and the {agent}s running on your hosts will
upgrade automatically.

[discrete]
[[fleet-server-intro]]
== {fleet-server}

{fleet-server} is the mechanism to connect {agent}s to {fleet}.  It allows for
a scalable infrastructure and is supported in {ecloud} and self-managed clusters.
{fleet-server} is a separate process that communicates with the deployed {agent}s.
It can be started from any available x64 architecture {agent} artifact.

For more information, refer to <<fleet-server>>.

[discrete]
[[fleet-communication-layer]]
== {es} as the communication layer

All communication between the {fleet} UI and {fleet-server} happens through
{es}. {fleet} writes policies, actions, and any changes to the `fleet-*`
indices in {es}. Each {fleet-server} monitors the indices, picks up changes, and
ships them to the {agent}s. To communicate to {fleet} about the status of the
{agent}s and the policy rollout, the {fleet-server}s write updates to the
`fleet-*` indices.

[discrete]
[[agent-self-protection]]
== {agent} self-protection

On macOS and Windows, {agent} can self-protect against malicious users and
attackers when the {endpoint-sec} integration is added to the agent policy. For
more information, refer to
{security-guide}/es-overview.html#self-protection[{elastic-endpoint} self-protection].

[discrete]
[[data-streams-intro]]
== Data streams make index management easier

The data collected by {agent} is stored in indices that are more granular than
you'd get by default with the Beats shippers or APM Server. This gives you more visibility into the
sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index
permissions. These indices are called <<data-streams,_data streams_>>.
