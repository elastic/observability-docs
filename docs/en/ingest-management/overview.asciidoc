[[elastic-agent]]
== {agent}

//TODO: We need to converge on a single definition for this product because
//we describe it in many different ways in these docs and others. I've made
//some minor edits to this description, but it still needs work.

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query 
data from operating systems, and more. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy
monitoring across your infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy you
can update to add integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

For more information, refer to <<elastic-agent-installation>>.

[[unified-integrations]]
== {integrations}

Our https://www.elastic.co/integrations/[integrations] provide an easy way to connect Elastic to external services and systems, and quickly get insights or take action.
They can collect new sources of data, and they often ship
with out-of-the-box assets like dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines to
extract structured fields out of logs and events. This makes it easier to get insights
within seconds. Integrations are available for popular services and platforms
like Nginx or AWS, as well as many generic input types like log files. 

{kib} provides a web-based UI to add and manage integrations. You can browse a
unified view of available integrations that shows both {agent} and {beats}
integrations.

See our https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations[list of integrations] to learn more about them.

[[configuring-integrations]]
== {agent} policies

Agent policies specify which integrations you want to run and on which hosts. 
You can apply an {agent} policy to multiple
agents, making it even easier to manage configuration at scale.

When you add an integration, you configure inputs for logs and metrics, such as the path to your Nginx access
logs. When you're done, you save the integration to an {agent}
policy. The next time enrolled agents check in, they receive the update.
Having the policies automatically deployed is more convenient
than doing it yourself by using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or some other tool.

For more information, refer to <<agent-policy>>.

If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may use YAML files and APIs.
{fleet} has an API-first design. Anything you can do in the UI, you
can also do using the {fleet-guide}/fleet-api-docs.html[`API`].
This makes it easy to automate and integrate with other systems.

[discrete]
[[package-registry-intro]]
== {package-registry}

The {package-registry} is an online package hosting service for the {agent}
integrations available in {kib}.

{kib} connects to the {package-registry} at `epr.elastic.co` using the Elastic
Package Manager, downloads the latest integration package, and stores its assets
in {es}. This process typically requires an internet connection because
integrations are updated and released periodically. You can find more information about running the {package-registry} in air-gapped
environments in the section about {fleet-guide}/air-gapped.html[Air-gapped environments].

[discrete]
[[central-management]]
== Central management in {fleet}

{fleet} provides a web-based UI in {kib} for centrally managing {agent}s and
their policies.

You can see the state of all your {agent}s in {fleet}. On the **Agents** page,
you can see which agents are healthy or unhealthy, and the last time they
checked in. You can also see the version of the {agent} binary and policy.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-agents-overview.png[Agents page]

{fleet} serves as the communication channel back to the {agent}s. Agents check
in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of agents
enrolled into each agent policy, which allows you to scale up to
thousands of hosts.

When you make a change to an agent policy, all the agents receive the update
during their next check-in. You no longer have to distribute policy updates
yourself.

When you're ready to upgrade your {agent} binaries or integrations, you can
initiate upgrades in {fleet}, and the {agent}s running on your hosts will
upgrade automatically.

[discrete]
[[selective-agent-management]]
=== Roll out changes to many {agent}s quickly

Some subscription levels support bulk select operations, including:

* Selective binary updates
* Selective agent policy reassignment
* Selective agent unenrollment

This capability enables you to apply changes and trigger updates across many
{agent}s so you can roll out changes quickly across your organization.

For more information, refer to {subscriptions}[{stack} subscriptions].

[discrete]
[[fleet-server-intro]]
== {fleet-server}

{fleet-server} is the mechanism to connect {agent}s to {fleet}.  It allows for
a scalable infrastructure and is supported in {ecloud} and self-managed clusters.
{fleet-server} is a separate process that communicates with the deployed {agent}s.
It can be started from any available x64 architecture {agent} artifact.

For more information, refer to <<fleet-server>>.

[discrete]
[[fleet-communication-layer]]
== {es} as the communication layer

All communication between the {fleet} UI and {fleet-server} happens through
{es}. {fleet} writes policies, actions, and any changes to the `fleet-*`
indices in {es}. Each {fleet-server} monitors the indices, picks up changes, and
ships them to the {agent}s. To communicate to {fleet} about the status of the
{agent}s and the policy rollout, the {fleet-server}s write updates to the
`fleet-*` indices.

[discrete]
[[agent-self-protection]]
== {agent} self-protection

On macOS and Windows, {agent} can self-protect against malicious users and
attackers when the {endpoint-sec} integration is added to the agent policy. For
more information, refer to
{security-guide}/es-overview.html#self-protection[{elastic-endpoint} self-protection].

[discrete]
[[data-streams-intro]]
== Data streams make index management easier

The data collected by {agent} is stored in indices that are more granular than
you'd get by default with the {beats} shippers or APM Server. This gives you more visibility into the
sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index
permissions. These indices are called <<data-streams,_data streams_>>.
