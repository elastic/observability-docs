default in every {ess} deployment). {ess-leadin-short}

Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the {kib} privileges in
all spaces.

* {es} cluster and {kib} (version {minor-version}) with a basic license or
higher. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Learn how to install the
{stack} on your own hardware].

* Secure, encrypted connection between {kib} and {es}. For more information,
see {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[Start the {stack} with security enabled].

* Internet connection for {kib} to download integration packages from the
{package-registry}. Make sure the {kib} server can connect to
`https://epr.elastic.co` on port `443`. If your environment has network traffic
restrictions, there are ways to work around this requirement.
See {fleet-guide}/air-gapped.html[Air-gapped environments] for more information.

* {kib} user with `All` privileges on {fleet} and {integrations}. Since many
Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the {kib} privileges in
all spaces.

* In the {es} configuration, the
{ref}/security-settings.html#api-key-service-settings[built-in API key
service] must be enabled.
(`xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true`)

* In the {kib} configuration, the saved objects encryption key
must be set. {fleet} requires this setting in order to save API keys and encrypt
them in {kib}. You can either set `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` to
an alphanumeric value of at least 32 characters, or run the
{kibana-ref}/kibana-encryption-keys.html[`kibana-encryption-keys` command] to
generate the key.

//TO DO: We need to test these recommendations to see which are still valid
//when users run security by default. I suspect the setup is easier than we
//are conveying here.

**Example security settings**

For testing purposes, you can use the following settings to get started quickly,
but make sure you properly secure the {stack} before sending real data.

elasticsearch.yml example:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true
----

kibana.yml example:

[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system" <1>
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: "something_at_least_32_characters"
----
<1> The password should be stored in the {kib} keystore as described in the
{ref}/security-minimal-setup.html[{es} security documentation].
