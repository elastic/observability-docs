* Access to an {es} cluster and {kib} (version {minor-version}) with a basic
license. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Learn how to install the
{stack} on your own hardware].

* Secure, encrypted connection between {kib} and {es}. See:
** {ref}/configuring-security.html[Configuring security in {es}]

TIP: You can disable the TLS check by setting
`xpack.ingestManager.fleet.tlsCheckDisabled: true` in the {kib}
configuration. For example, you might want to do this if {kib} is
behind a proxy that terminates the SSL connection.

* User with the superuser role. See {ref}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in roles].

* In the {es} configuration, the
{ref}/security-settings.html#api-key-service-settings[built-in API key
service] must be enabled.
(`xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true`)

* In the {kib} configuration, the saved objects encryption key
(`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`) must be set to any alphanumeric
value of at least 32 characters. {fleet} requires this setting in order to save
API keys and encrypt them in {kib}.
