* Access to a deployment of our https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {ess}]
on {ecloud}. The {ess} is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. {ess-trial}[Try it out for free].

* User with the superuser role. See {ref}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in roles].

* Access to an {es} cluster and {kib} (version {minor-version}) with a basic
license. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Learn how to install the
{stack} on your own hardware].

* Secure, encrypted connection between {kib} and {es}. See:
** {ref}/configuring-security.html[Configuring security in {es}]
** {kibana-ref}/using-kibana-with-security.html[Configuring security in {kib}]
** {kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html[Encrypt communications in {kib}]

TIP: You can disable the TLS check by setting
`xpack.fleet.agents.tlsCheckDisabled: true` in the {kib}
configuration. For example, you might want to do this if {kib} is
behind a proxy that terminates the SSL connection.

* User with the superuser role. See {ref}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in roles].

* In the {es} configuration, the
{ref}/security-settings.html#api-key-service-settings[built-in API key
service] must be enabled.
(`xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true`)

* In the {kib} configuration, the saved objects encryption key
(`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`) must be set to any alphanumeric
value of at least 32 characters. {fleet} requires this setting in order to save
API keys and encrypt them in {kib}.

**Example security settings**

For testing purposes, you can use the following settings to get started quickly,
but make sure you properly secure the {stack} before sending real data.

elasticsearch.yml example:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true
----

kibana.yml example:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.fleet.agents.tlsCheckDisabled: true
xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: "something_at_least_32_characters"
elasticsearch.username: "my_username"
elasticsearch.password: "my_password"
