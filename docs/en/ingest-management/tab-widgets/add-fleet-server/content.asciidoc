{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {integrations-server} that includes
{fleet-server}. No extra setup is required unless you want to scale your
deployment.

To confirm that an {integrations-server} is available in your deployment:

. In {kib}, go to **Management > {fleet}**.
. On the **Agents** tab, look for the **{ecloud} agent policy**. This policy is
managed by {ecloud}, and contains a {fleet-server} integration and an Elastic
APM integration. You cannot modify the policy. Confirm that the agent status is
**Healthy**.

[TIP]
====
Don't see the agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
{integrations-server} instance. This instance is required to use {fleet}.

// tag::self-managed[]

To deploy a self-managed {fleet-server}, you install an {agent} and enroll it in
an agent policy containing the {fleet-server} integration.

NOTE: You can install only a single {agent} per host, which means you cannot run
{fleet-server} and another {agent} on the same host unless you deploy a
containerized {fleet-server}.

. In {kib}, go to **Management > {fleet} > Settings**. For more information
about these settings, see {fleet-guide}/fleet-settings.html[{fleet} settings].
// lint ignore fleet-server
. Under **Fleet Server hosts**, click **Edit hosts** and specify one or more host
URLs your {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}. Save and apply your settings.

TIP: If the **Edit hosts** option is grayed out, {fleet-server} hosts
are configured outside of {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{fleet} settings in {kib}].

. In the **{es} hosts** field, specify the {es} URLs where {agent}s will send data.
For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`. Skip this step if you've started the
{stack} with security enabled (you cannot change this setting because it's
managed outside of {fleet}).

. Save and apply the settings.

. Click the **Agents** tab and follow the in-product instructions to add a
{fleet} server:

**Notes:**

* Choose **Quick Start** if you want {fleet} to generate a
{fleet-server} policy and enrollment token for you. The {fleet-server} policy
will include a {fleet-server} integration plus a system integration for
monitoring {agent}. This option generates self-signed certificates and is not
recommended for production use cases.
* Choose **Advanced** if you want to either:
** Use your own {fleet-server} policy. You can create a new {fleet-server}
policy or select an existing one. Alternatively you can
{fleet-guide}/create-a-policy-no-ui.html[create a {fleet-server} policy without using the UI],
and select the policy here.
** Use your own TLS certificates to encrypt traffic between {agent}s and
{fleet-server}. To learn how to generate certs, refer to
{fleet-guide}/secure-connections.html[Configure SSL/TLS for self-managed {fleet-server}s].
* It's recommended you generate a unique service token for each
{fleet-server}. For other ways to generate service tokens, see
{ref}/service-tokens-command.html[`elasticsearch-service-tokens`].
* If you are providing your own certificates:
** Before running the `install` command, make sure you replace the values in
angle brackets. 
** Note that the URL specified by `--url` must match the DNS name used to
generate the certificate specified by `--fleet-server-cert`.
* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy. For more {fleet-server} commands, see
{fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-cmd-options.html[{agent} command reference].

If installation is successful, you'll see confirmation that {fleet-server}
connected. Click **Continue enrolling Elastic Agent** to begin enrolling your
agents in {fleet-server}.

NOTE: If you're unable to add a {fleet}-managed agent, click the **Agents** tab
and confirm that the agent running {fleet-server} is healthy.
