{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {fleet-server}. No extra setup is required
unless you want to scale your deployment.

To confirm that {fleet-server} is available in your deployment:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.
. Click the *Agents* tab.
. Under *Agent policy*, look for *Elastic Cloud agent policy* --
{fleet-server} is the agent enrolled in the Elastic Cloud agent policy.
This policy is managed by {ecloud}. You cannot modify it.
Confirm that the agent status is *Healthy*.

[TIP]
====
Don't see the {fleet-server} agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
APM & {fleet} node. This node is required to use {fleet-server}.

NOTE: When using our hosted {ess}, it's recommended that you use our hosted
version of {fleet-server}. However, you can choose to deploy and self-manage
{fleet-server}s.

// end::ess[]

// tag::self-managed[]

To deploy a self-managed {fleet-server}, install an {agent} and enroll it in an
agent policy containing the {fleet-server} integration.

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*. The first time you visit
this page, it might take a minute to load.

. Click *{fleet} settings*, and in the *{fleet-server} hosts* field, specify the
URLs {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}.

. In the *{es} hosts* field, specify the {es} URLs where {agent}s will send data.
For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`.
+
For more information about these settings, see <<fleet-settings>>.

. Save and apply the settings.

. Click the *Agents* tab and follow the in-product instructions to add a
{fleet} server:

*Notes:*

* Make sure you download an x64 architecture installation package.

* For the agent policy, choose one with a {fleet-server} integration. If
one doesn't exist, create it.

.What is a {fleet-server} policy?
****
It is an agent policy that contains a {fleet-server} integration. In
self-managed clusters, a default {fleet-server} policy is created
automatically when you run {fleet} for the first time. If you are deploying a
self-managed {fleet-server} to work with our hosted {ess}, you
must explicitly <<create-a-policy,create a new agent policy>> that includes a
{fleet-server} integration.
****

* If you choose *Production* deployment mode, read <<secure-connections>> to
learn how to generate certs.

* It's recommended you generate a unique service token for each
{fleet-server}. For other ways to generate service tokens, see
{ref}/service-tokens-command.html[`elasticsearch-service-tokens`].

* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy. For example, the following command installs
a {fleet-server} and uses self-signed certs:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install  -f \
  --fleet-server-es=http://localhost:9200 \
  --fleet-server-service-token=AAEbAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlaXQtc2VydmVzL3Rva2VuLTE2MeIzNTY1NTQ3Mji6dERXeE9XbW5RRTZqNlJMWEdIRzAtZw \
  --fleet-server-policy=27467ed1-1bfd-11ec-9b88-a7c3d83e2897
----
+
The following command installs a {fleet-server} and uses certificates you
provide. Make sure you replace the values in angle brackets.
+
[source,yaml]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=https://192.0.2.1:8220 \ <1>
 -f \
 --fleet-server-es=https://192.0.2.0:9200 \
 --fleet-server-service-token=AAEAaWVsYXN0aWcvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3rva2VuLTE2MzIzNTYcNTQ3MjI6dER1eE9XbW5RRTZqNlJMWEdIRzAtZw \

  --certificate-authorities=<PATH_TO_CA> \
  --fleet-server-es-ca=<PATH_TO_ES_CERT> \
  --fleet-server-cert=<PATH_TO_FLEET_SERVER_CERT> \
  --fleet-server-cert-key=<PATH_TO_FLEET_SERVER_CERT_KEY>
----
<1> The URL must match the DNS name used to generate the certificate specified
by `--fleet-server-cert`.
+
For more {fleet-server} commands, see <<elastic-agent-cmd-options>>.
+
If installation is successful, you'll see the {fleet-server} {agent} on the
*Agents* tab in *{fleet}*. Notice that the Default Fleet Server Policy is
assigned to the {agent}. This policy is created when you run {fleet} for the
first time.
