{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {integrations-server} that includes
{fleet-server}. No extra setup is required unless you want to scale your
deployment.

To confirm that an {integrations-server} is available in your deployment:

. In {kib}, open the main menu, and go to *Management > {fleet}*.
. On the *Agents* tab, look for the *{ecloud} agent policy*. This policy is
managed by {ecloud}, and contains a {fleet-server} integration and an Elastic
APM integration. You cannot modify the policy. Confirm that the agent status is
*Healthy*.

[TIP]
====
Don't see the agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
{integrations-server} instance. This instance is required to use {fleet}.

// tag::self-managed[]

To deploy a self-managed {fleet-server}, install an {agent} and enroll it in an
agent policy containing the {fleet-server} integration.

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet} > Settings*. For more
information about these settings, see
{fleet-guide}/fleet-settings.html[{fleet} settings].

// lint ignore fleet-server
. Under *Fleet Server hosts*, click *Edit hosts* and specify one or more host
URLs your {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}. Save and apply your settings.

. In the *{es} hosts* field, specify the {es} URLs where {agent}s will send data.
For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`. Skip this step if you've started the
{stack} with security enabled (you cannot change this setting because it's
managed outside of {fleet}).

. Save and apply the settings.

. Click the *Agents* tab and follow the in-product instructions to add a
{fleet} server:

*Notes:*

* Make sure you download an x64 architecture installation package.

* For the agent policy, choose one with a {fleet-server} integration, or click
*Create policy* to create one now. Alternatively you can 
{fleet-guide}/create-a-policy-no-ui.html[create a {fleet-server} policy without using the UI],
then select the policy here.

* If you choose *Production* deployment mode, learn how to generate certs in
{fleet-guide}/secure-connections.html[Configure SSL/TLS for self-managed
{fleet-server}s].

* It's recommended you generate a unique service token for each
{fleet-server}. For other ways to generate service tokens, see
{ref}/service-tokens-command.html[`elasticsearch-service-tokens`].

* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy. For example, the following command installs
a {fleet-server} and uses self-signed certs:

If installation is successful, you'll see the {fleet-server} {agent} on the
