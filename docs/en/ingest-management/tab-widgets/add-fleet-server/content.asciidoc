{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {integrations-server}. No extra setup is
required unless you want to scale your deployment.

To confirm that an {integrations-server} is available in your deployment:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.
. Click the *Agents* tab.
. In the *Agent policy* column, look for *Elastic Cloud agent policy* --
This policy is managed by {ecloud}, and contains a {fleet-server}
integration and an Elastic APM integration. You cannot modify the policy.
Confirm that the agent status is *Healthy*.

[TIP]
====
Don't see the agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
{integrations-server} instance. This instance is required to use {fleet}.

NOTE: When using our hosted {ess}, it's recommended that you use our hosted
version of {integrations-server}. However, you can choose to deploy and
self-manage {integrations-server}s.

// end::ess[]

// tag::self-managed[]

To deploy a self-managed {fleet-server}, install an {agent} and enroll it in an
agent policy containing the {fleet-server} integration.

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*. The first time you visit
this page, it might take a minute to load.

. Click *{fleet} settings*, and in the *{fleet-server} hosts* field, specify the
URLs {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
=======
NOTE: You can install only a single {agent} per host, which means you cannot run
{fleet-server} and another {agent} on the same host unless you deploy a
containerized {fleet-server}.

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet} > Settings*. For more
information about these settings, see
{fleet-guide}/fleet-settings.html[{fleet} settings].
// lint ignore fleet-server
. Under *Fleet Server hosts*, click *Edit hosts* and specify one or more host
URLs your {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
>>>>>>> ddd563c4 (Mention that only one Elastic Agent can run on a host (#1856))
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}.

. In the *{es} hosts* field, specify the {es} URLs where {agent}s will send data.
For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`.
+
For more information about these settings, see
{fleet-guide}/fleet-settings.html[{fleet} settings].

. Save and apply the settings.

. Click the *Agents* tab and follow the in-product instructions to add a
{fleet} server:

*Notes:*

* Make sure you download an x64 architecture installation package.

* For the agent policy, choose one with a {fleet-server} integration. If
one doesn't exist, create it.

.What is a {fleet-server} policy?
****
It is an agent policy that contains a {fleet-server} integration. In
self-managed clusters, a default {fleet-server} policy is created
automatically when you run {fleet} for the first time. If you are deploying a
self-managed {fleet-server} to work with our hosted {ess}, you
must explicitly
{fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html#create-a-policy[create a new agent policy] that
includes a {fleet-server} integration.
****

* If you choose *Production* deployment mode, learn how to generate certs in
{fleet-guide}/secure-connections.html[Encrypt traffic in clusters with a
self-managed {fleet-server}].

* It's recommended you generate a unique service token for each
{fleet-server}. For other ways to generate service tokens, see
{ref}/service-tokens-command.html[`elasticsearch-service-tokens`].

* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy. For example, the following command installs
a {fleet-server} and uses self-signed certs:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install  -f \
  --fleet-server-es=http://localhost:9200 \

The following command installs a {fleet-server} and uses certificates you
provide. Make sure you replace the values in angle brackets.

<1> The URL must match the DNS name used to generate the certificate specified
by `--fleet-server-cert`.

For more {fleet-server} commands, see
{fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-cmd-options.html[{agent} command reference].
+
If installation is successful, you'll see the {fleet-server} {agent} on the
*Agents* tab in *{fleet}*. Notice that the Default Fleet Server Policy is
assigned to the {agent}. This policy is created when you run {fleet} for the
first time.
