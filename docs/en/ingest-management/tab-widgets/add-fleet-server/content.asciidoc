No extra setup is required. {ecloud} runs a hosted version of {fleet-server}.

To confirm that {fleet-server} is available in your deployment:

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.
. Click the *Agents* tab.
. Under *Policies*, confirm that {fleet-server} is running and healthy. 

{fleet-server} is the agent enrolled in the Elastic Agent on Cloud policy.
This policy is managed by {ecloud}. You cannot modify it.

Don't see the {fleet-server} agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
APM & {fleet} node. This node is required to use {fleet-server}.

To deploy {fleet-server} on a self-managed cluster, install an {agent} and
enroll it in the default {fleet-server} policy. The policy is created
automatically when you run {fleet} for the first time.

To add {fleet-server}:

//TODO: Mention API for adding the token.

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*. The first time you visit
this page, it might take a minute to load.

. Click *{fleet} settings*, and in the *{fleet-server} hosts* field, specify the
URLs {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}.

. In the *{es} hosts* field, specify the {es} URLs where {agent}s will send data.
For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`.

. Save and apply the settings.

. Click the *Agents* tab and follow the in-product instructions to add a
{fleet} server:

*Notes:*

* Make sure you download an x64 architecture installation package.
* After generating the service token, save it to a secure location. You might
need to use this token later to scale your deployment by adding {fleet-server}s. 
* The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install -f --fleet-server-es=http://localhost:9200 \
--fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2MTkxMzg3MzIzMTg6dzEta0JDTmZUZGlDTjlwRmNVTjNVQQ
----
+
If installation is successful, you'll see the {fleet-server} {agent} on the
*Agents* tab in *{fleet}*. Notice that the Default Fleet Server Policy is
assigned to the {agent}. This policy is created when you run {fleet} for the
first time.
