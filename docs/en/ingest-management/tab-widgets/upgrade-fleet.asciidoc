{ecloud} runs a hosted version of {fleet-server}.

To confirm that {fleet-server} is available in your deployment:

// lint ignore fleet
. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > Fleet*, and click the *Agents* tab.
. The following message is displayed. Please note that your {agent}s have now
been unenrolled and have stopped sending data. 
+
Select *Do not show this message again*, and then click *Close and get started*.

+
If your previous deployment did not include an APM node, you are prompted to enable *APM & Fleet*,
required for using {fleet-server}.
+
Click *Edit deployment* and add an *{integrations-server}* node to your deployment.

+
. To confirm that {fleet-server} is available in your deployment, click the *Agents* tab.
. Under *Policies*, select the *{ecloud} agent policy* to confirm that {fleet-server}
is listed. This policy is managed by {ecloud} and can not be modified.
+
You are now able to install and enroll subsequent {agent}s with {fleet-server}.

To upgrade to {fleet-server}:

//TODO: Mention API for adding the token.

. Log in to {kib} and go to *Management > {fleet}*.
. Click the *Agents* tab.
. The following message is displayed. Please note that your {agent}s have now
been unenrolled and have stopped sending data.
+
Select *Do not show this message again*, and then click *Close and get started*.

. Click *{fleet} settings*, and in the *{fleet-server} hosts* field, enter the
URLs {agent}s will use to connect to {fleet-server}. For example,
`https://192.0.2.1:8220`, where `192.0.2.1` is the host IP where you will
install {fleet-server}.

. In the *{es} hosts* field, specify the {es} URLs where {agent}s will send data.
For example, `https://192.0.2.0:9200`.

. Save and apply the settings.

. Click the *Agents* tab and follow the in-product instructions to add a
{fleet-server}.
+
Start with downloading the {agent} artifact of your choice to the host
to run the {fleet-server}:

+
The `install` command installs the {agent} as a managed service and enrolls it
in a {fleet-server} policy. The example below is for Linux and MacOS hosts (Windows usage
will be similar):
+
[source,yaml]
----
sudo ./elastic-agent install -f --fleet-server-es=http://localhost:9200 \
--fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2MTkxMzg3MzIzMTg6dzEta0JDTmZUZGlDTjlwRmNVTjNVQQ
----
+
IMPORTANT: For DEB or RPM artifact usage, substitute the `install` command for `enroll`.
This is because DEB and RPM usage inherently include installing the {agent} files to disk,
and so the `install` command is incompatible with them.
+
When the installation is successful, you'll see the {fleet-server} {agent} on the
*Agents* tab in *{fleet}*.
+
You now need to install and enroll your {agent}s.
