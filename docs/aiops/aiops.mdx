The AIOps capabilities available in Elastic ((observability)) enable you to consume and process large observability data sets at scale, reducing the time and effort required to detect, understand, investigate, and resolve incidents.
Built on predictive analytics and ((ml)), our AIOps capabilities require no prior experience with ((ml)).
DevOps engineers, SREs, and security analysts can get started right away using these AIOps features with little or no advanced configuration:

These features are designed to work with alerting, case management,
and other incident management features that let you tie into additional third-party systems and integrate with your team's workflows.
