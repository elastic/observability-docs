The **Inventory** page provides a metrics-driven view of your entire infrastructure grouped by
the resources you are monitoring. All monitored resources emitting
a core set of infrastructure metrics are displayed to give you a quick view of the overall health
of your infrastructure.

To access the **Inventory** page from the main ((observability)) menu, go to
**Infrastructure → Inventory**.

## Filter the Inventory view

To get started with your analysis, select the type of resources you want to show
in the high-level view. From the **Show** menu, select one of the following:

* **Hosts** (the default)
* **Kubernetes Pods**
* **Docker Containers**
* **AWS**, which includes EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, and SQS queues

When you hover over each resource in the waffle map, the metrics specific to
that resource are displayed.

You can sort by resource, group the resource by specific fields related to it, and sort by
either name or metric value. For example, you can filter the view to display the memory usage
of your Kubernetes pods, grouped by namespace, and sorted by the memory usage value.

You can also use the search bar to create structured queries using [((kib)) Query Language](((kibana-ref))/kuery-query.html).
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to view only the information for `host1`.

To examine the metrics for a specific time, use the time filter to select the date and time.

## View host metrics

By default the **Inventory** page displays a waffle map that shows the hosts you
are monitoring and the current CPU usage for each host.
Alternatively, you can click the **Table view** icon <DocImage flatImage alt="Table view icon" url="../images/table-view-icon.png" />
to switch to a table view.

Without leaving the **Inventory** page, you can view enhanced metrics relating to each host
running in your infrastructure. On the waffle map, select a host to display the host details
overlay.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
To expand the overlay and view more detail, click **Open as page** in the upper-right corner.
</DocCallOut>

The host details overlay contains the following tabs:

<HostDetails />

<DocCallOut title="Note">
These metrics are also available when viewing hosts on the **Hosts**
page.

## View metrics for other resources

When you have searched and filtered for a specific resource, you can drill down to analyze the
metrics relating to it. For example, when viewing Kubernetes Pods in the high-level view,
click the Pod you want to analyze and select **Kubernetes Pod metrics** to see detailed metrics:

<div id="custom-metrics"></div>

## Add custom metrics

If the predefined metrics displayed on the Inventory page for each resource are not
sufficient for your specific use case, you can add and define custom metrics.

Select your resource, and from the **Metric** filter menu, click **Add metric**.

## Integrate with Logs and APM

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you can view logs or traces relating to a specific resource.
For example, in the high-level view, when you click a Kubernetes Pod resource, you can choose:

* **Kubernetes Pod logs** to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityLogMonitoring" text="view corresponding logs" /> in the ((logs-app)).
* **Kubernetes Pod APM traces** to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApm" text="view corresponding APM traces" /> in the ((apm-app)).
