In this guide you'll learn how to onboard system metrics data from a machine or server,
then observe the data in Elastic ((observability)).

To onboard system metrics data:

1. <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityCreateAnObservabilityProject">Create a new ((observability)) project</DocLink>, or open an existing one.
1. From the main menu in Elastic ((observability)), go to **Infrastructure** → **Inventory** or **Hosts**.
1. In the upper-right corner, click **Add data**.
1. Type **System** in the search bar, then select the integration to see more details about it.
1. Click **Add System**.
1. Follow the in-product steps to install the System integration and deploy an ((agent)).
The sequence of steps varies depending on whether you have already installed an integration.

    * When configuring the System integration, make sure that **Collect metrics from System instances** is turned on.
    * Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for your host.
      For example, you may want to turn on **System core metrics** to get a complete view of your infrastructure.

Notice that you can also configure the integration to collect logs.

<DocCallOut title="What if ((agent)) is already running on my host?">
    Do not try to deploy a second ((agent)) to the same system.
    You have a couple options:

    * **Use the System integration to collect system logs and metrics.** To do this,
        uninstall the standalone agent you deployed previously,
        then follow the in-product steps to install the System integration and deploy an ((agent)).
    * **Configure your existing standalone agent to collect metrics.** To do this,
        edit the deployed ((agent))'s YAML file and add metric inputs to the configuration manually.
        Manual configuration is a time-consuming process.
        To save time, you can follow the in-product steps that describe how to deploy a standalone ((agent)),
        and use the generated configuration as source for the input configurations that you need to add to your standalone config file.
</DocCallOut>

After the agent is installed and successfully streaming metrics data,
go to **Infrastructure** → **Inventory** or **Hosts** to see a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure.
