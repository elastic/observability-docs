<DocAccordion buttonContent="Overview">

![Host metrics](../images/metrics-overlay.png)

The **Overview** tab displays metrics about the selected host, including CPU usage,
normalized load, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic, and the log rate.

Change the time range to view metrics over a specific period of time.

Hover over a specific time period on a chart to compare the various metrics at that given time.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Metadata">

![Host metadata](../images/metadata-overlay.png)

The **Metadata** tab lists all the meta information relating to the host,
including host, cloud, and agent information.

This information can help when investigating events—for example,
when filtering by operating system or architecture.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Processes">

![Host processes](../images/processes-overlay.png)

The **Processes** tab lists the total number of processes (`system.process.summary.total`) running on the host,
along with the total number of processes in these various states:

* Running (`system.process.summary.running`)
* Sleeping (`system.process.summary.sleeping`)
* Stopped (`system.process.summary.stopped`)
* Idle (`system.process.summary.idle`)
* Dead (`system.process.summary.dead`)
* Zombie (`system.process.summary.zombie`)
* Unknown (`system.process.summary.unknown`)

The processes listed in the **Top processes** table are based on an aggregation of the top CPU and the top memory consuming processes.
The number of top processes is controlled by `process.include_top_n.by_cpu` and `process.include_top_n.by_memory`.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Command** | Full command line that started the process, including the absolute path to the executable, and all the arguments (`system.process.cmdline`). |
| **PID** | Process id (`process.pid`). |
| **User** | User name (`user.name`). |
| **CPU** | The percentage of CPU time spent by the process since the last event (`system.process.cpu.total.pct`). |
| **Time** | The time the process started (`system.process.cpu.start_time`).  |
| **Memory** | The percentage of memory (`system.process.memory.rss.pct`) the process occupied in main memory (RAM).  |
| **State** | The current state of the process and the total number of processes (`system.process.state`). Expected values are: `running`, `sleeping`, `dead`, `stopped`, `idle`, `zombie`, and `unknown`. |

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Logs">

![Host logs](../images/logs-overlay.png)

The **Logs** tab displays logs relating to the host that you have selected. By default, the logs tab displays the following columns.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Timestamp** | The timestamp of the log entry from the `timestamp` field.  |
| **Message** | The message extracted from the document. The content of this field depends on the type of log message. If no special log message type is detected, the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](((ecs-ref))/ecs-base.html) base field, `message`, is used. |

To view the logs in the ((logs-app)) for a detailed analysis, click **Open in Logs**.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Anomalies">

![Anomalies](../images/anomalies-overlay.png)

The **Anomalies** table displays a list of each single metric ((anomaly-detect)) job for the specific host. By default, anomaly
jobs are sorted by time, showing the most recent jobs first.

Along with the name of each anomaly job, detected anomalies with a severity score equal to 50 or higher are listed. These
scores represent a severity of "warning" or higher in the selected time period. The **summary** value represents the increase between
the actual value and the expected ("typical") value of the host metric in the anomaly record result.

To drill down and analyze the metric anomaly, select **Actions → Open in Anomaly Explorer**.
You can also select **Actions → Show in Inventory** to view the host Inventory page, filtered by the specific metric.
