To follow the steps in this guide, you need an ((stack)) deployment that includes:

* ((es)) for storing and searching data
* ((kib)) for visualizing and managing data
* Kibana user with `All` privileges on ((fleet)) and Integrations. Since many
    Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the Kibana privileges
    in all spaces.

* Integrations Server (included by default in every ((ess)) deployment)

To get started quickly, spin up a deployment of our hosted ((ess)). The ((ess)) is
available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. [Try it out for free](((ess-trial))).
