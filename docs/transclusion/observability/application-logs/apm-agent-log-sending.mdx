Elastic APM agents can automatically capture and send logs directly to the managed intake service &mdash; enabling you to
easily ingest log events without needing a separate log shipper like ((filebeat)).

**Requirements**

The Elastic APM agent for your programming language.

**Pros**

* Simple to set up as it only relies on the APM agent.
* No modification of the application required.
* No need to deploy ((filebeat)).
* No need to store log files in the file system.

**Cons**

* Experimental feature.
* Limited APM agent support.
* Not resilient to outages. Log messages can be dropped when buffered in the agent or in the managed intake service.

**Supported APM agents/languages**

* Java
