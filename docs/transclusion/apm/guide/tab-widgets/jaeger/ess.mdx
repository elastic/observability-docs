1. Log into [((ecloud))](((ess-console))) and select your deployment.
    In ((kib)), select **Add data**, then search for and select "Elastic APM".
    If the integration is already installed, under the polices tab, select **Actions** -> **Edit integration**.
    If the integration has not been installed, select **Add Elastic APM**.
    Copy the URL. If you're using Agent authorization, copy the Secret token as well.

1. Configure the APM Integration as a collector for your Jaeger agents.

    As of this writing, the Jaeger agent binary offers the following CLI flags,
    which can be used to enable TLS, output to ((ecloud)), and set the APM Integration secret token:

    ```terminal
    --reporter.grpc.tls.enabled=true
    --reporter.grpc.host-port=<apm-url:443>
    --agent.tags="elastic-apm-auth=Bearer <secret-token>"
    ```

For the equivalent environment variables,
change all letters to upper-case and replace punctuation with underscores (`_`).
See the [Jaeger CLI flags documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.27/cli/) for more information.
