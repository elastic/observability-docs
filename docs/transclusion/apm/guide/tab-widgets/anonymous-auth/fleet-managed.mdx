When an <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmApiKeys">API key</DocLink> or <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmSecretToken">secret token</DocLink> is configured,
anonymous authentication must be enabled to collect RUM data.
Set **Anonymous Agent access** to true to enable anonymous authentication.

When configuring anonymous authentication for client-side services,
there are a few configuration variables that can mitigate the impact of malicious requests to an
unauthenticated APM Server endpoint.

Use the **Allowed anonymous agents** and **Allowed anonymous services** configs to ensure that the
`agent.name` and `service.name` of each incoming request match a specified list.

Additionally, the APM Server can rate-limit unauthenticated requests based on the client IP address
(`client.ip`) of the request.
This allows you to specify the maximum number of requests allowed per unique IP address, per second.
