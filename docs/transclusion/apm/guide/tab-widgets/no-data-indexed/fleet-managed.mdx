**Is ((agent)) healthy?**

In ((kib)) open **((fleet))** and find the host that is running the APM integration;
confirm that its status is **Healthy**.
If it isn't, check the ((agent)) logs to diagnose potential causes.
See [Monitor ((agent))s](((fleet-guide))/monitor-elastic-agent.html) to learn more.

**Is APM Server happy?**

In ((kib)), open **((fleet))** and select the host that is running the APM integration.
Open the **Logs** tab and select the `elastic_agent.apm_server` dataset.
Look for any APM Server errors that could help diagnose the problem.

**Can the ((apm-agent)) connect to APM Server**

To determine if the ((apm-agent)) can connect to the APM Server, send requests to the instrumented service and look for lines
containing `[request]` in the APM Server logs.

If no requests are logged, confirm that:

1. SSL isn't <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmTroubleshooting" section="ssl-client-fails-to-connect">misconfigured</DocLink>.
1. The host is correct. For example, if you're using Docker, ensure a bind to the right interface (for example, set
    `apm-server.host = 0.0.0.0:8200` to match any IP) and set the `SERVER_URL` setting in the ((apm-agent)) accordingly.

If you see requests coming through the APM Server but they are not accepted (a response code other than `202`),
see <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityApmTroubleshooting">APM Server response codes</DocLink> to narrow down the possible causes.

**Instrumentation gaps**

APM agents provide auto-instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries.
If the ((apm-agent)) is not auto-instrumenting something that you were expecting, data won't be sent to the ((stack)).
Reference the relevant [((apm-agent)) documentation](((apm-agents-ref))/index.html) for details on what is automatically instrumented.
